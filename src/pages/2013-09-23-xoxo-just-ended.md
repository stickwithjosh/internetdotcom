Today, after hearing hours of talks about and for this small (but ever expanding) creative class I have accidentally found myself to be a part of, I keep hearing a voice telling me to **be brave**.

Life can be scary and hard, even when you have the odds in your favor. Sometimes situations seem so dark and hopeless I find myself paralyzed not by fear, but by an apathy that grips me in the deepest way.

But,_ even inside_ that dark and hopeless place, there is life, and friendship and love and endorphins and all of the things that make you smile when you pause long enough to see what is happening while you are so busy. Busy running away from your internal struggles. Busy worrying instead of working. Busy being scared that you donâ€™t bring anything _unique_ or _cool_ or _useful_ to the table.

So, this is for future Joshua: **Be brave**.
