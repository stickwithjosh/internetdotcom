I've been a little obsessed with [Now, Now's](http://nownowband.com/) latest ([Threads](http://shop.hellomerch.com/products/threads-cd-or-12-vinyl) on Chris Walla's [Trans Reocrds](http://trans-records.com/)). I'm seeing them tonight along with [Motion City Soundtrack](http://motioncitysoundtrack.com) and [Jukebox The Ghost](http://jukeboxtheghost.com). I'm pretty excited.
