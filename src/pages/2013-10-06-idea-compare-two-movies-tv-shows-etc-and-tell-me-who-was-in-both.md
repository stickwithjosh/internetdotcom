title: "IDEA: Compare two (movies, tv shows, etc) and tell me who was in both"
---
Idea: I frequently see someone in a movie and think, ”Is that the person who was in x?”. Sometimes x is a TV show or another movie or some other thing.

Currently I usually look at IMDB, try to remember what the character was named, have a hard time associating whatever I’m watching with the small press photos on IMDB and then give up.

I'd like to be able to throw the name of the two properties into a form somewhere and get back any people that appeared in both. Bonus points if that included directors and maybe even *Six Degrees Kevin Bacon*-style connections (this person was in this with this person who starred in the thing you searched for).
