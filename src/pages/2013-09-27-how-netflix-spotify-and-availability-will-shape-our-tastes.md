title: "How Netflix, Spotify and availability will shape our tastes"
---
I’m starting to wonder about how the availability of media will shape my tastes, and perhaps more severely, the tastes of my son.

The media my family consumes comes in three varieties:

**New Stuff**: I see tons of movies in the theater and my wife and I watch Breaking Bad & Game of Thrones typically the same night that they come out.

**Streaming subscriptions**: We subscribe to Hulu, Netflix and Rdio. This is a huge chunk of the things we consume.

**Available “freely” on the internet**: YouTube, Soundcloud, etc.

##Availability

One of my favorite songwriters [David Bazan](http://www.davidbazan.com/) has [been an outspoken critic of Spotify](https://twitter.com/davidbazan/status/303883219617587200) even calling it “class warfare” [during his Great Discontent interview](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/david-bazan). His recent albums aren’t on Rdio because of this stance.

Similarly, [Gungor](http://gungormusic.com/) is another band I’m very fond of that [isn’t publishing their latest album to streaming music services](https://twitter.com/gungormusic/status/382625594157985792) because they feel the streaming music business doesn’t value their work enough.

On the whole, most new music and a huge portion of older work is available via Rdio and similar services — but there are pockets of missing stuff all over the place and it’s not just with music. I’m sure there are "content owners" making similar decisions for their TV shows and Movies.

**No hate**: I think it’s important to point out that I’m not judging any of these people for making what amount to business decisions. They have these choices to make and none of the options I see seem ideal for artists.

##Ambient consumption

I’ve purchased all of Bazan’s music and most of Gungor’s - but the purchased music I have lives in iTunes or the Music app on my phone. 

Because of my preferenes, when I listen to music I use Rdio almost exclusively. Jumping over to iTunes for one or two bands rarely happens, although when it does I typically listen to entire albums multiple times. Generally when I queue up music to listen to while working, or when I play music at home while we’re having dinner these artists’ music isn’t even an option.

When Melissa and I are poking around for something to watch on television after Conor goes to sleep, we’re much more likely to look at [Instantwatcher](http://instantwatcher.com/) to see what’s newly available via Netflix than anything else.

One of my families favorite movies is [Hayao Miyazaki](http://letterboxd.com/director/hayao-miyazaki/)’s ([Ponyo](http://letterboxd.com/film/ponyo/) which we learned about while cruising Netflix one evening. It was also one of the first movies my son took an interest in when he was entirely too small to take an interest in movies.

Sadly, Ponyo was removed from Netflix streaming (and from the iTunes store) at some point in the last two years. Of course, we have various quasi-legal ways to watch it, but as it stands now we just watch this terrific film much less and it makes us sad all the day.

This is what you see when you search for David Simon’s *The Wire* on Netflix. Because it’s not available for instant streaming, Netflix offers up alternatives, even going so far as to document that when people search for *The Wire* members stream these alternative shows.

##But, what does it mean?

Most of these points are well trodden elsewhere, but the thing I’m most fascinated by is how availability adjusts our consumption patterns.

I used to have a 300GB music library. It was massive, but some of my most listened to music during that period was: American Analog Set, Alkaline Trio, The Album Leaf, The Appleseed Cast, American Football, All-Time Quarterback.

Notice that all of these bands’ names start with an ‘A’ placing them at the top of my iTunes artist browsing. Frequently, rather than search for something in particular I would play something I new would be good that was already staring me in the face.

Similarly I wonder about the sort of media my son will remember from this period of his life. Is it possible things that are more readily available will weigh differently in his memory simply because they’ve been around more? Will independent content that avoids the typical streaming services find smaller and smaller audiences or will the limited availability of their content make it seem even more valuable and highly sought after because of the exclusivity?

How will the business decisions of these artists (and their partners) shape cultures’ view of them in the long run?
