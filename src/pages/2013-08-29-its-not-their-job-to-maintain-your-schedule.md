This morning I got an email from a client delaying work I was expecting to start 3 days before the email for a further 10 days.

The circumstances were outside of the client's control but it was a good reminder of an idea I've tried to keep in mind while scheduling.

##It’s not real until I’ve got a payment

I'm a one man army. 90% of the time when I'm doing contracting work it's me against the world. I’m the sales department, I'm marketing, I’m collections and I‘m the person doing all the [internets](http://giphy.com/gifs/5weDonl12u0tG).

When dealing with a client, there are a lot of things that can get in the way before a project actually becomes work, so it is important that I treat all work as hypothetical until I have a payment in my bank account securing my time.


##What money means

Money, even the relatively small two weeks payment that [I request to kick off new projects](http://www.joshuablount.com/work#availability), is the fundamental power structure when speaking business (along with her cousins time and quality).

When a client hands over a payment it means:

1. They have money (if they give you some of their money that is a pretty good indicator that they have more somewhere else).
2. They are prepared for the project to start
3. They are invested in the success of the project

When a client tries to avoid a retainer it says to me:

1. They may not have any money.
2. They have nothing significant invested in the success of the project.
3. They may or may not be ready to start the project.

##Taking it easy

When cash flow is good, it’s easy to think, “I don't need to take payment up front, I've got expenses for the next couple months taken care of” but even when your cash flow is bump-free that doesn't mean the client has skin in the game.

When clients haven't paid anything yet they are a bazillon times more likely to flake out altogether, be slow to answer questions and there is zero affirmation that they even have money to pay you when the project is complete.

##Reasons

Frequently I deal with larger clients that have a particular method or schedule with which they pay their vendors and contractors and I do my best to accommodate them. More and more, I'm realizing that this accommodation does nothing for my business and places the entirety of the risk of the proposition on my end.

One client in particular didn't want to do any retainer and stipulated that I could invoice for time worked every 30 days and they would in turn pay those invoices net-30. So I would receive the first part of my payment a full 60 days after work had been kicked off.

##Just like Goodfellas.

Low on work? Stick to your preferred payment schedule.
Really interested in the project? Stick to your preferred payment schedule.
Nervous about sounding like a tool? Stick to your preferred payment schedule.

It's no ones responsibility to ensure you get paid but yours. If you want to make sure you're able to continue payment rent and buying those diet sodas you like so much, setup up terms you can live with and stick to them.

If the client isn't willing to pay by your terms it's unlikely it would have been a successful client and you can expend that energy on someone willing to pay for your expertise.
