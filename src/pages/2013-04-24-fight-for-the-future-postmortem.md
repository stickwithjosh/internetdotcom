Yesterday they cut my hours at the gig I've been contracting for (more than full-time) for the past (nearly) two years. Effectively that means I'm sort of unemployed right now, and I wanted to document a few things.

###Fight for the Future

When I got an email from Tiffiniy about her new project I didn't immediately realize she was one of the founders behind [Downhill Battle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downhill_Battle). It took me about 24 hours to convince them and we were building [Free Bieber](http://freebieber.org) almost the next day. We didn't name ourselves for another few weeks if I remember correctly. We landed on [Fight for the Future](http://fightforthefuture.org).

FFTF's website says, “a nonprofit working to expand the internet's power for good” but they explained it to me sort of like the EFF's younger, more aggressive, sister.

I worked, a lot, for our campaigns up until Monday and at this point we've never lost a fight.

###Lessons

A few things I wanted to make sure to remember:

* **Don't work like a founder if you aren't one** - FFTF doesn't owe me anything, and it was my pleasure to work with them—but I worked like an insane person to make things happen there. Beyond the collective good we accomplished as an organization and the friends I made along the way, I have very little to take away from that. I need to learn how to be a good employee and team mate without pouring myself into something that isn't mine.

* **Ask why, a lot more** - Every single time we built something the very first priority was to build it as quickly as possible. Had I been aware of this in the moment, I would have pushed back more on that demand so that we could collectively be more proud of our work and accomplish more. Sure, *we helped organize the largest online protest in history* but it didn't need to come at the expense of having to explain away our shortcuts every time a technical friend asks about them.

* **Speaking of shortcuts, don't get involved in an organization based solely around emailing people** - So much of email deliverability is out of your hand, and [we had our share of problems](http://www.fightforthefuture.org/apology) attempting to get the message out to people, but there's a reason people hate email and organizations sending it are part of that problem. For me, the more bulk email I get the less happy I am. I don't want to participate in that cycle— especially when there are so many other cool and interesting ways to connect with human beings. 

* **Your colleagues can and should be more important than your work** - One thing I feel like I did well and hope to continue to do well is to treat my colleagues with respect and familiarity. Even working remotely, I spent more time with the people working with me on FFTF projects than with many of my family members, and I tried my best to treat them like that. Judging by the love and support they've showed me so far I was successful.

###What now?

I'm looking for work, hoping to have something lined up shortly. 

I do the sort of things [that are detailed here](http://joshuablount.com/work). Development, a little design, making websites and stuff like that. I'll even edit video or audio for you.

Contract stuff and full-time gigs are interesting right now, not sure what exactly I'll be doing in the short-term so hit me up. The best fit would be on a small team where I can have a big impact and a seat at the table to help make decisions about the (project, product, work), but I'm open to hearing from just about anyone.

###Thanks

In case this sounded like an attack or like it was born in frustration, I wanted to clearly and publicly thank Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson. The work I did with them and the other people we collaborated with was hard and interesting and fun and if I could do it all over again I'd sign up just as quickly.
