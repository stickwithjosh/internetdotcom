It used to be that I after spending days or weeks on a fresh version of a website I would start testing Internet Explorer.

Testing in Interest Explorer used to mean dropping features, hours of frustration and wrangling for a at-least-passable experience. It was awful.

These days, partially because of advances in IE coupled with a industry wide leveling up of CSS best practices opening IE for testing typically means finding a few isolated problems that are easy to fix.

Occasionally I realize that I left a stray "console.log()" in my javascript or forgot to include a [polyfill](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7087331/what-is-the-meaning-of-polyfills-in-html5) for some missing feature in IE8. It rarely takes more than an hour or two and is infrequently frustrating.

So, thanks Microsoft. I know we give you a hard time, but I appreciate you putting money and effort into Internet Explorer. Youâ€™ve made my professional life a little better as a result.
