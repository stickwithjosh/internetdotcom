I love [Rdio](http://rdio.com) - if you told me a few years ago that I would listen to 100% purchased / licensed music I would have laughed at you. But Rdio has given me the gift of legality and [I am eternally grateful](http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/138361/We/).

The fact that I use Rdio so much (probably bordering on 10-12 hours a day) means I end up with a huge list of annoyances and grievances. Here's one: Rdio's Heavy Rotation shouldn't show me stuff I've listend to recently or stuff that's in my collection.

According to the interface Heavy Rotation is "Popular albums that we think you will like based on who you follow and what you listen to." but I think it could be even better! This is exactly where I go when I'm looking for some new jams (although on Tuesdays I usually start at New Releases). Almost all of my favorite albums from the last couple years have been from bands I already loved or from Heavy Rotation.

The problem? Heavy Rotation takes a lot of work from my eye balls that Rdio could be doing for me. When I look at the current view I see 12 albums (there are more behind a scroll) 10 of which I've listened to in the past 2 weeks and / or are already in my Collection. Check it:

One other web service I really love is [Letterboxed](http://letterboxd.com) (use hypothetical in the beta code spot skip the wait list). They've got some great thinking when it comes to this sort of stuff, see how they highlight movies I haven't seen on a friend's list?
