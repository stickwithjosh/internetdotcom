My weight fluctuates a lot. I lost 30lbs between October and December of last year, gained it back January through March.

I'm not 100% sure why I have such a hard time with this stuff, but I think it mostly boils down to self-control and mood. [Everything's connected.](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/76447036619/hi-im-gone-again)

When I acknowledge this and kick off a few months of eating better, I really prefer taking the low-carb method over others like counting calories. Less math, infrequent hunger pangs, and the ability to eat at just about every place I would normally eat are huge wins.

One problem with low-carb eating is that I frequently have to modify existing meals, “Can I have the biscuit (that has egg, bacon and sausage) without the biscuit?” leads to questions about replacing the biscuit with other problematic food items.

Eventually I usually end up feeling the need to say, “I'm chubby, so I'm eating low carb right now.”

That feels great. Super great.
