title: "Generosity as a way to recenter yourself"
---
When Melissa and I first got married, I had never given money to the church consistently.

It wasn't even on my radar. I knew my dad wrote a check most Sundays, but I have no idea how much or when I should start doing the same. I still felt like a kid, surely this is something grown-ups did?

Melissa never really asked if we'd be tithing, she just started doing it with our joint account and expected me to follow suit. Nine years later we're still doing that.

Over time, giving away a portion of our income consistently has taught me a lot. It's revealed that no matter what we do or don't have in our checking account, it always seems to be enough. It's helped me see how much money and material things effect my decisions and shape my life.

**I think, in a very small way, it reminds me that I am not the center of the world, I actually play a small part in a much larger story.**

Now I consider generosity to be a *non-optional* part of my life. For me, that means giving to the church community I'm a part of and finding other ways to give what I have (money, time, etc) to people could use the help.

For me this isn't totally about them, it's also about me. Acknowledging that I'm a piece of a whole is important to my still shaping beliefs about how the universe works.

For the past few years, [Melissa](http://twitter.com/melissablount) and I have [matched donations to Charity:Water on my birthday](https://my.charitywater.org/third-annual-waterpalooza). It's a small thing, but it's another way to remind myself that while I'm so grateful to be alive and in the position I'm in, all of that is related to all of the other things going on in the world.

On a day when so many people are telling me that they are glad I exist, I want to remind myself that my existence is connected to everything else. I want to participate in the re-shaping of the world around the collective good.

[One of my favorite songs](http://youtu.be/2rhgzqyk5Mo?t=7m28s) [1] has this really incredible bridge that reminds me of these ideas:

> And when our voices fail us we will find new ways to sing.<br />
When our bodies fail we’ll find joy in the peace that it brings.<br /> <br /> 
The world is a beautiful place, but we have to make it (that way /  better).<br />
Whenever you find home, we’ll make it more than just a shelter.<br />
And if everyone belongs there, it will hold us all together.<br />
If you’re afraid to die, then so am I.

I'd just love it if you could [donate to Charity:Water today](https://my.charitywater.org/third-annual-waterpalooza). Together we can **fight back the darkness** that is still left in the world, and the darkness that consumes us.
