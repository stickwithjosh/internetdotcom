One of the major downsides to using a streaming service like [Rdio](http://rdio.com) for most of my music is availability. The business of music sometimes keeps your favorite artists from appearing in the places you like, which makes some of your favorite music scarce some of the time.

One interesting benefit to this artificial scarcity is The Joyâ„¢ that comes with discovering something has become available.

Piebald's album *We Are the Only Friends We Have* is one of my favorites. It was put out in 2002 by Big Wheel, and it never showed up on Rdio likely because of contractual obligations or failed labels or whatever.

Anyway, the first twelve songs on [III](http://rd.io/x/QFF1PkfNOw/) are the same twelve songs from the 2002 album. Listen, enjoy and marvel at modern technology.
