1. Try your best to make it the same size, for Godâ€™s sake.
2. See #1, but also know that delivery is easily worth approximately $200 of effort, time, stress of driving around with a bed sticking out of your vehicle and rental trucks.
3. Samsies if you need to buy a mattress, although add the stress of your poor wife who is absolutely convinced the mattress strapped to the roof of the ZipCar van will fall off and injure everyone.
4. Don't live on the 12th floor of an apartment building.
5. See number five, although if that can't be fixed don't try and take the entire bed down during a weekday morning. Your clients will not appreciate your tardiness.
6. Do not buy IKEA beds if you an avoid it, but if you must make sure that the dumb moving company doesn't break it, strip all the screws, and generally make things awful.
