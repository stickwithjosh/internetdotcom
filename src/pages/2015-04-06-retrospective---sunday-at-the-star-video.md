Last month [the church we're a part of](http://thegroveschurh.com) did a small brunch event featuring bands that are a part of our community. It was really great, and along with handling co-MC duties I tasked myself with shooting a video of the event.

## Stacked Odds

When I first decided to do this, I did not know it would be right in the middle of three cross country trips in a six week period. In fact, the night before I got back to my apartment at around 9PM after flying all day Saturday, so I didn't have time to do most of the preparation I would have liked to do before hand.

## Prep

I had planned on using a newly purchased [Nebula 4000](http://filmpower.us/products/nebula4000-lite-3-axis-gyroscope-stabilizer-for-a7s-gh4-bmpcc-gopro-iphone-gimbal) (3-Axis Gyroscope Stabilizer) during the shoot to make things look a little more cinematic and less DIY. Sadly, it came in too late for me to take with me on the previous week's business trip, so the hour before the event started was the entire time I had to try and get it balanced and learn how to use it.

An hour was not even close to enough time, and I decided to through it back in my bag so I could focus on the gear I was familiar with.

## Gear

Here's a list of the things I used. I operated everything myself, which was a mistake.

Three mirrorless APSC camera bodies:

* [Sony a6000](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I8BICB2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00I8BICB2&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=YAZP5TLWC3D6ZGEU)
* [Sony NEX 5T](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ENZRP38/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ENZRP38&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=J4Y4URZHDSO4H7NA)
* [Olympus OM-D E-M5](http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Interchangeable-Touchscreen-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B0074WDERI/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1428358251&sr=1-1&keywords=Olympus+OM-D+E-M5+16MP)

Along with a handful of lenses:

* [Olympus 25mm f1.8](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HWMP0XG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HWMP0XG&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=54QOCICG4IT6SRDB) - terrific micro 4/3 prime lens - when the Olympus was my daily carry camera, this was always attached.
* [Sony 18-200mm F3.5-6.3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00836H2DQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00836H2DQ&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=MJKU2YBPXJHKRUV5) - This is the only Sony / E-Mount zoom I own, so absolutely critical for a live event where I was attempting to shoot without people noticing me for the most part.
* [Sony Zeiss 24mm f1.8](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IHAI8O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005IHAI8O&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=C3BQO4FEFFFV73LU) - this is actually my daily lens but I didn't use it much. For wider shots I usually opted for the 16mm pancake and the 55mm is a better choice shooting people because you can be a few steps further away to avoid freaking anyone out.
* [Sony Zeiss 55mm f1.8](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FSB799Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FSB799Q&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=4NCYETEUZJ4W4ACJ) - I think is my favorite lens. So incredibly sharp, really terrific for low light situations.
* [Sony 16mm f2.8](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NRHAH8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003NRHAH8&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=SQH3BON4WS43AOZZ) & the [Fisheye Conversion Lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Q0BPC8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003Q0BPC8&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=NMWEVFB3CCSMCZ56) that goes with it - This lens is pretty soft in the corners and is so wide that there is quite a bit of barrel distortion even without the fisheye converter, but I loved having the fisheye option, particularly for the setup shot at the back of the stage that you see early on.

Other gear:

* [StudioFX 40" Slider](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BOGOT4M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BOGOT4M&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=SBFP5W7JCIKILKKL)
* Two [different](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WKOENO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003WKOENO&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=NGJB4NZFTMIMHQC6) [tripods](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RBX0GO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004RBX0GO&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=RM37TQVQHRZ6S365)
* [Sony Gun Zoom Microphone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HWGZSX4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HWGZSX4&linkCode=as2&tag=josblodotcom-20&linkId=M7PRRN75FBKLHXEF) - I left this on my camera for incidental audio and ended up using audio from it almost exclusively rather than the pre-recorded music I had planned to use as a bed. Surprisingly good in the space.

Which is to say, a ridiculous amount of gear, but I used every single item (with the potential exclusion of the 24mm lens) and can point to multiple shots where each thing was critical to getting the footage I did.

## Approach

I didn't have extensive plans. I've shot a few similar low-budget one-person live event videos before so I had a little experience with what I would like to have when I got back to my laptop to edit something together. I also knew I wanted between 1-3 minutes for the finished product so I'd basically want to try and keep at least two of the cameras recording at any given point.

To pull that off, I had my a6000 on a sling strapped to me for active shooting and the other two cameras on tripods or the slider shooting the rest of the time. This approach worked really well, and while ideally I would have someone working with each camera directly, I was actually pleased with most of the coverage I got.

One downside I didn't consider until after the event of doing everything myself: Most of the between band banter happened while I was on stage or just about to get on stage, so I didn't get very much footage of the bands and other people speaking to the crowd.

## The Result

Here's the resulting video. At 1:30 I think it's a pretty good representation of the event and our community:

Also interesting, here's [the fifteen second version](https://instagram.com/p/ztP23NIOIT/) I did all with footage from the camera I had strapped to me and edited in about 30 minutes while waiting for my laptop to do an unrelated piece of work. The full edit took about four hours of editing but I was surprised at how close I stayed in format to the small one.

## Surprisingly

I was really well surprised at the footage I had to work with when I got home, here are a few things that worked out really well before we get to the problems:

* **Audio** - the Sony Gun Zoom mic worked perfectly for the venue. It captured balanced and rich sound making the bands sound pretty good. I didn't do hardly any post-production audio work because of how full it sounded, which was much better than my plan of over-dubbing songs from [our EP](http://music.thegroveschurch.com/album/living-room-ep).
* **The Venue** - while it was a touch difficult to get around some of the spots without injuring an innocent bystander with a tripod, [The Star Theater]() is a beautiful venue and while lighting was a little tough, the character of the venue more than makes up for that.
* **One Person Shoot** - While it wasn't ideal to handle this all myself I found running three cameras and helping MC the event to totally be doable.

## Next Time

There were of course a ton of things I wish I had handled differently

* **The Kidâ„¢** - Melissa was also helping run this event, and we both 1/2 expected the other person to be hanging out with our 4-year old. Luckily we were able to manage it with help from friends, but I should have been more explicit in setting up a plan to make sure he was well taken care of.
* **Friends** - While I was able to pull this off, I was so busy I didn't get to hang out much with friends that came to hang out. Not sure how to fix this one without having other people do all the video work, but maybe there is a way.
* **More preparation** - I would have loved to spend more time doing prep work. I could have brought in some help, gotten to use my stabilizer and better handled the dim lighting with a little extra prep, but my travel precluded any of that.
* **Working with light** - I was trying my hardest to avoid getting any significant grain in the footage but ended up with images that were a lot dimmer than I anticipated. Between that and switching between taking footage of the very dimly lit crowd and the well lit stage I really should have been more careful about my exposure and lighting.
* **External monitors** - One thing I found to be true was that switching between cameras and dialing in aperture and ISO a ton because of changing angles meant having a hard time anticipating the resulting image. Having external monitors on every camera would probably be ideal, but even using something to isolate the eye pieces to help set things up might be super helpful.
* **Music** - Arriving at the venue I had assumed they had the ability to give me a dump of audio. I should have checked in with them before hand, but when I asked the already overwhelmed person running sound seemed pretty frantic, so I gave up on getting a dump. This worked out OK, but next time I would make sure I had plans to pull the audio from the soundboard directly.
* **Take your time** - When I sat down with the footage I realized that I had really rushed through tons of my shots. I was a little nervous of being annoying dragging gear all over the place and shooting footage of people at a distance so I would find a shot I wanted, setup super quick, and then try to get out of there before anyone noticed. That's mostly OK for handheld stuff, but getting balance and angles right with the tripod and slider shots could have provided me with a ton of extra footage to work with.


## End Credits

Generally very happy with this project. I probably spent 10-13 hours on it in total between planning, shooting and editing. I probably could eventually cut that down to a more reasonable 4-5 hours sometime in the future, which sounds like the right sort of commitment.
