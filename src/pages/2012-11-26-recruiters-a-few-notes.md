Hello recruiters! Thanks so much for working hard to find jobs for nerds everywhere. A few (hopefully brief) pointers:

1. Java and Javascript are entirely different things. Confusingly Coffeescript is a superset of Javascript and totally related to it.

2. PHP, Java, Ruby and Python are all web backend development languages. Generally you'll find that people with no history with one of the languages probably isn't interested in that language with the possible exception of python and ruby, because advocates of both languages can appreciate the other.

3. I know there is a load of money to be made in recruiting - if you can learn just a little bit about development and the sort of things that you're signing people up for you could make a killing. Try going to a local programming meet up or user group once a month, make a few friends you can IM or text with questions. You'll be better informed, get more people jobs, and likely make loads of money without seeming like an asshole.



Most developers I've met hate recruiters. I've gotten well over 100 cold calls and well over 1,000 cold emails from recruiters introducing themselves to me - without regard to my current job situation - in order to begin a relationship with me that would end in them being paid for finding me a new job.

Recruiters, [according to this post on Yahoo! Answers](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070510064646AA3ubzW), frequently make a low base salary supplemented by commission based on placing hires with new companies ([This post](http://teksystemsseattle.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/through-the-eyes-of-an-it-recruiter-how-do-recruiters-get-paid/) mentions a few other methods of recruiter pay). Their goal is to get someone hired at one of their clients as quickly as they can so they can do that same thing again.

Every recruiter I've ever spoken to or been emailed by has been technically incompetent. I've never communicated to a recruiter who understand the job I was being hired for, and I have never been hired as a result of the involvement of a technical recruiter.
