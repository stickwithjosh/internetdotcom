title: "Be productive, anywhere"

Recently I got a new laptop when the last MacBook Air updates came out (holy battery life batman) and finally switched to using vim full-time. I've used vim part-time for years, but always switched to TextMate or some other third party GUI editor when I needed to copy or paste long chunks to shift them around, but have always wanted to use as little 3rd party software as possible for work. 

This week, I was [at the office of a client](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/367348597366341633) who had a small Django project on one of their machines they wanted me to do some bug fixes on. I hadn't planned on doing the work in their office, but since I was sitting down at the machine anyway I started poking around and got two of the three problems solved in a couple hours.

Now, while this isn't ideal and probably not a way to work on your own machine, it was really nice that the iMac could be so similar to my laptop. In fact, the only thing I added to the machine while I was sitting there was [ack](http://beyondgrep.com) (via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) which was already installed).

Getting from new machine to productive quickly isn't the most useful skill I have, but it sure is handy. Whether you are pairing with someone, helping them over the shoulder or working from a machine you don't own it's remarkable how nice it is to feel at home no matter where you are.

My recommendation? Use what's installed on your machine out of the box, evaluate each installation of third party software with suspicion and never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.
