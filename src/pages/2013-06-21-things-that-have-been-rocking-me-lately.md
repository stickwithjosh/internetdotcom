Matt Haughey says that [Gmail’s Organized Inbox is a life changer](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2013/06/gmails-organized-inbox-is-a-life-changer.html) and he's totally right. It's absolutely made my email situation better and I would have totally missed it if he hadn't written about it.

Emily Strickland wrote about [luck, unfairness, or as she referred to it "caprice"](http://emily.st/log/posts/2013/jun/20/caprice/). I totally identify with what she suggests might be a version of survivor or "success" guilt and a desire to ”…spread this professional success, my tech accomplishments, to my friends who may be struggling, who are equally talented but in another place in life.” (I'm also wondering if, for me, this desire to spread my own success is another way in which I'm looking down on people that are in a different place in life, but that's another topic altogether.)

Jon Lax (of [teehan+lax](http://www.teehanlax.com)) documented his decision [to be a Patron of XOXO Festival (again)](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/why-were-an-xoxo-festival-patron-again/). I was literally moved to tears thinking of how exciting, life-giving and interesting last year's event was for me personally. I've got some thoughts about this years attendee selection process, but I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it publicly just yet.
