title: "Dealing with Diagnosis"
---
After a [few](http://shirt.joshuablount.com/posts/2010/ways-tell-im-not-feeling-well-mental-illness/) [years](http://shirt.joshuablount.com/posts/2011/i-spent-last-couple-weeks-kind-crazy/) of [dealing](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/76447036619/hi-im-gone-again) with increasing periods of depression and mood swings, I've (officially?) been diagnosed with [Bipolar II Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder).

While it's nice to have a diagnosis and a name, and I'm hoping that the medication I've been prescribed will help alleviate some of the symptoms I've experienced the last six or so years, it's also a little discouraging that I can't just brush it off.

Previously, when I got through one of my down / up times I could pretend that I was just being overly dramatic about having a problem. Now that I've seen five mental health professionals and they all agreed about what is wrong, it's hard to imagine away.

Even more so, there is some possibility that I'll be taking the medicine I've been prescribed for the rest of my life. Other than tattoos, Melissa and Conor I don't think I have any other life long commitments.

It's likely I'll also have a relationship with a therapist for the rest of my life. At this point that means seeing someone and talking about how I'm feeling every week, at some point that might dial back to every month but we'll see.

We'll see how this all works out. Melissa remains the constant that is helping me make sense of the ups and downs of my personal mental landscape while trying to make the best decisions for my self and for the well being of our family. My gratefulness for her cannot be measured.
