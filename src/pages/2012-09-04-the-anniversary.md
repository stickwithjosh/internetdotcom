My favorite way to wake up is gradually. When I can afford the time,  I love to take about 20 minutes warming up to the idea while still in bed. So much in my life happens quickly, or even while I'm not paying attention, I cherish being able to take the long way with my brain.

Today, September 4th, is the one year anniversary of my mom's death.

I decided that the best way to cope was to stay busy and let my brain adjust to the event over time. Driving across town for coworking and lunch with friends, working out, and in a few minutes worship practice.

I also put (supportive and wonderful) friends and family on mute. I deleted the Facebook app from my phone and broke access to facebook.com on my computer. I even unfollowed my poor sister on Instagram (sorry Rebecca!)

We all have our process, today this is mine. I hope tomorrow it's a little better.
