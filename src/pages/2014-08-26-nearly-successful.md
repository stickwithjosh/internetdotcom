I just had another really great introductory phone call with a new client, which made me feel a touch reflective.

I’ve been doing remote contract web development for the last year and a half. I’m starting to feel successful. Here are some notes on what has worked for me:

### Getting started

Initially, I was short on work - last summer I went almost two months between gigs. My guess is this stemmed from two problems: not having an existing base of clients to give me new work and not having existing clients (& friends) that were forwarding new work toward me.

After those first two months work has been increasingly steady. I think the largest time I’ve been without work was one week excluding a week’s vacation I took while in Florida over the holidays.

If you asked me where my work comes from it would be hard for me to come up with an answer. Two current projects came about because of doing interviews for full-time gigs that didn’t pan out. One was a result of a Twitter friend forwarding work to me that he couldn’t take on. Another was a recommendation based on an existing client relationship.

All of it is a mystery to me. I’ve taken to telling [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stickwithjosh) every month or so that I do work. That seems to be enough to keep me busy. A few friends usually hype me up, and work trickles in. No job boards, no hustle, just reminders.

### Rates

I’ve been publishing [my hourly and weekly rates](http://www.joshuablount.com/work#availability) for the last year and a half. Initially I published my rate so that I wouldn’t bring it down—I had a tendency to be skittish about what I would quote clients in person or over the phone.

What I’ve found, at least anecdotally, is that publishing my rate cuts down on prospective clients contacting me and later dropping the conversation when we start talking quotes.
The higher my rate goes the less negotiation I end up doing. New clients just seem to be OK with my rates and we spend more time talking about their project instead of haggling over the final dollar amount.

### Office

While we were moving apartments in March I thought it would be a good idea to start working from coffee shops instead of a dedicated coworking space. This was a dumb idea.
I‘ve been working at a rented desk inside a PR companies office for the last few months after this realization. It’s been good for my focus, and has provided some hilarious anecdotes about how people who aren’t nerds think about computers.

### Problems

#### Hourly Billing

I’m investigating ways to do project based billing instead of hourly billing. Billing hourly incentivizes extending deadlines on projects instead of finishing them. I’m not consciously doing this, but I would like to reverse that. The faster I can get a project done and get the project deployed then the faster I can start on a new project.

#### Taxes

I’m also about 1.5 years behind on my taxes. The IRS has pretty great terms (if you are willing to wait a few hours on hold) and we’re catching up slowly. When I first went back to contracting I expected to pick up a full-time gig before long and never really set things up for the long term which I’m paying for now.

#### Income “Streams”

One other small thing is that my income is tied to my ability to do development each day. With my various brain problems it’d be real nice to have an alternate way to make money.

#### Twitter

Ok, I love Twitter. Most of my work begins as a result of relationships developed on Twitter, but I need to be a little more careful about what exactly I say about clients on Twitter.

In one case this year a client pulled me off a project because I was making fun of the client’s new project manager. The guy was a racist jerk, but I should have spoken to him directly instead of talking behind his back.

***Related:*** If you’re a racist jerk, don’t hire me because I’ll have to confront you directly.

### Want to work together?

I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least mention that you could work with me. I do contract web development usually with some combination of Django, Angular, Node and similar tools, but I try to stay flexible. [Hit me up](http://www.joshuablount.com/work) if you think we could work together.
