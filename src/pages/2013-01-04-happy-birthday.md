My mom’s birthday is (was?) on January 4th.

It always seemed like a weird date to me. When I say “January 4th” in my head, it always feels so much like an impostor July 4th.

It’s hard on days like these to not feel overwhelmingly sad. It’s hard to avoid thinking about how she’ll never get to watch Conor grow older. It’s worse to realize that Conor won’t know his Grandma Terri outside of the stories I whisper to him.

My mom would have HATED us moving across the country. She also would have been the first person to jump on a plan to come visit.

My mom was frequently self-centered (a trait I fear she passed on to her eldest son) but similarly she did her best to be generous and to help when she could.

My mom at different points in her life had 3, 5, 7 or 10 children and she did her best to make sure each one felt loved and appreciated.

My mom and I had vastly different ideas about success and happiness but in all stages of life she was happy when I was happy.

I loved my mom, and she loved me. I miss her very much, but this is the universe that I live in. The one where she is gone. Remembering her is how I plan on eulogizing life.
