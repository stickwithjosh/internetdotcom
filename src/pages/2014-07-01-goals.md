Today on my calendar there is an all day event named "Portland" which my wife informed me was our estimated move date for relocating to Oregon.

When I have goals, particularly if they're very long term or hard to wrap my head around, I'll throw them into Google Calendar. At least they'll be documented and I can consider it later. It's not particularly useful for planning, but is a great tool to remind myself when I've met or failed various plans.

In this case, I beat my estimate by quite a bit.
