##Problem

Large or medium sized companies frequently have money and desire to outsource the hiring process. The technical recruiting firms that have sprung up around this money are nearly useless in spite of a considerable amount of work available and plenty of competent developers.

##Solution

Small development recruiting business. A list would make this faster to type:

1. Flat fee for hire ($3k? $2k? Something like that. Steep, but not bad and cheaper I think than most technical recruiting agencies. I'd probably also split it in two, maybe 25% for starting the search and 75% for successful hire?).
2. Knowledgable recruiters (maybe a couple years experience, send your recruiters to conferences maybe once a quarter to learn, not to head hunt)
3. No contracts for exclusivity (If the company hires the recruiter, and they end up hiring someone we point them at, they would still be contracted to pay the recruiter.)

I imagine this small recruiter working more like a job board and less like the current technical recruiters. Focusing on developers (app, web, whatevs) seems like a pretty good target, but I could imagine focusing on a particular business (start-ups?) and expanding that as you hired experts to handle it.

There has been [loads](http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/2012/09/17/disrupt/) of [talk](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4532768) about this particular subject, and I don't think my ideas are that unique, but I would guess that they'd be successful.
