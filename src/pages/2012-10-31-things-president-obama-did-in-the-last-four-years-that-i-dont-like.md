title: "Things President Obama did in the last four years that I don't like"
---
I've gotten into a few political discussions over the last few weeks on Facebook. I'm finding that text comments aren't the most productive place to have these sorts of discussions, as I get lost in research and documentation while watching the other party wave off my answers because of the sources.

Something I frequently want to recount are the three primary things President Obama has done over the last four years that I'm disappointed with, here they are in no particularly order.

1. **He didn't close down [Guantánamo Bay](http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/01/07/2578082/why-obama-hasnt-closed-guantanamo.html)** (although while researching this it seems pretty clear that the reason he hasn't been able to shut it down yet has been the complicated nature of what to do with the detainees + who pays for it + congress getting in the way). This is actually a potential violation of the [UN conventions against torture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Torture).

2. **In May of 2011, President Obama resigned the provisions of the [USA Patriot Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#Reauthorizations)** that required resigning. The Patriot Act is a law, but some of the provisions in it (including the roaming wiretaps stuff and library records provision) require re-upping because it's thought that these extended threats to civilians could be used to invade law abiding citizens privacy.

3. **President Obama also signed the NDAA for 2012**, which is really just the laws that lay out the budget for the Department of Defense. The problem is that the NDAA for 2012 included this [wacky but outlining that the President can detain citizens without trial indefinitely under certain circumstances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012#Indefinite_detention_without_trial:_Section_1021). This is actually very much related to Guantánamo Bay, where prisoners are currently being held without trial.

So, those three things are actually pretty heinous and against what I want our President to do. Having documented them all here, they kind of feel like they are all part of the same basic intrusions against privacy on the basis of the terrorist acts of September 11th, 2001 and I hope that all of these things will be corrected as quickly as possible.
