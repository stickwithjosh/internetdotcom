We are moving.

Not the drastic move [we did last year](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/30103182596/moving). We're just moving to a new apartment in the same city.

We had a few requirements, and finally landed on a building we liked. After initially dismissing it because it was out of our price range, we saw it drop $600 / month and went back to take a second look.

The apartment is terrific, the views are amazing, and the two minor down sides are that it isn't very close to a park and there is no onsite fitness center / gym / treadmill. Small downsides - sign us up, we'll move in four weeks.

When I arrived home a link to the application was in my email from the apartment "Assistant Property Manager" along with the following paragraph:

> [person that showed us the apartment] relayed to me that you are interested in moving in on March 1st. This home is currently available, if you were to move-in today on a 13 month lease, pricing is $[acceptable price] per month. If you wanted to take the home on March 1st, pricing on a 13 month lease is $[acceptable price + $200] per month.

Infuriating. Who does this work on? What sort of person can afford to pay double rent one month but is also hesitant to accept a slightly inflated rate?

The best part? After doing the math, the March 1st rate is actually identical to the lower rate with a $100 cheaper final month.

My plan at the moment is simply to avoid talking to them, watch their craigslist ad for updates on the price, and come back to them at the last minute. I'll update here with where that lands us for the final monthly price.
