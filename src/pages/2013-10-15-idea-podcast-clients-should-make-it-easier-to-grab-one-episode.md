title: "IDEA: Podcast clients should make it easier to grab one episode"
---
<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts, I&#8217;m subscribed to maybe 40 of them and have between 10-12 that I listen to every single week and listen to the others as time and interest dictate.</p>

<p><a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast">Instacast</a> Has a <em>terrific</em> new rolling queue feature that helps me line up episodes so I can spend much less time deciding what to listen to and much more time listening. Add things to the queue from the episodes that have been downloaded and theyâ€™ll play in order.</p>

<p>Frequently I&#8217;ll come across the link to a particular episode of a podcast that I want to listen to because of the content, but I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d like to subscribe to the show (like <a href="http://www.podcastone.com/pg/jsp/program/episode.jsp?programID=540&amp;pid=346278">this interview with Marco Arment</a> someone <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/09/23/overcast-coming-soon">who is making</a> <a href="https://overcast.fm">a podcast client</a>, HOW INTERESTING).</p>

<p>What I would like is to be able to add a single episode to my queue, ideally by pasting the url to the episodes web page. My podcast client would find the episode and download it, letting me listen to it inside my preferred context.</p>

<p>For bonus points: Take note of the podcast feed and leave me a notification with the option to subscribe to the new show after I&#8217;ve listened to the initial episode.</p>
