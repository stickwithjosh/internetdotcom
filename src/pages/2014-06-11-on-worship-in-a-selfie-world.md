title: "On “Worship in a Selfie World”"
---
Yesterday as I was listening to the just-released [David Bazan & Passenger String Quartet Volume 1](https://undertow.myshopify.com/collections/david-bazan/products/david-bazan-passenger-string-quartet-volume-1) a friend sent me a link to [this article](http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/worship-in-a-selfie-world) from [Stephen Miller](http://stephen-miller.com/) on John Piper's [Desiring God](http://www.desiringgod.org/).

When I saw the link's address I was turned off. I'm [not](http://www.christianpost.com/news/john-piper-explains-why-women-shouldnt-lead-men-59818/) a [fan](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2013/02/04/john-pipers-influence-is-he-says-irrespective-of-competency/) of [Piper's](http://thewartburgwatch.com/2012/05/07/john-piper-women-are-free-to-go-to-the-bathroom-without-a-mans-permission/) [work](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2014/03/26/the-gospel-coalition-is-very-upset-with-those-who-refuse-to-participate-in-their-lie/) (Most of those link are to [Slacktivist](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/) which I'm a *huge* fan of), but I was intrigued because my pal [Nathan](http://nathanialgarrod.com) specifically mentioned he disagreed with the authors negative opinion regarding selfies, of which, I too am a fan.

**Back to the point:** “Worship in a Selfie World” feels genuine. I believe that Miller is convinced of what he is saying, I just think he might be missing the point.

###The Selfie

Just to lay a bit of ground work, let's consider the often maligned selfie. You know who seems to get frustrated by selfies? Old men. They seem to have a hard time connecting with them at all.

Of course this is frequently the case, and frequently with time we realize that change is hard, and changing social dynamics can be really hard on entire groups of people - but that those changes are not always bad.

When my grandfather saw me wearing hilariously baggy pants, he assumed I had no interest in my appearance and no pride in my family. Nothing could be further from the truth for my middle school aged self. I loved my family dearly and was very proud of my looks such as they were, but my expression was just different than what he expected. He never did stop talking about my "clown pants", for which I loved him dearly.

Similarly when my father's generation started seeing other people turning cameras around I can totally understand how they would draw the immediate conclusion that selfies are indicative of something broken in a changing culture. Selfie, self-involvement, self-interest. But what is easy to conclude is not always what is correct.

One thing that might help you better understand the selfie is video calling. Skype, FaceTime, whatever. When we call friends and family from our various devices and use video, we don't show them what we are looking at, we show them ourselves as a way to better connect with them.

It has brought me great joy to call my wife and son when I'm away from home. If they pushed a button and showed me the wall that they are looking at I would be more than a little frustrated, in fact, when Conor was younger I'm pretty sure he used to do this and it was annoying (toddlers!).

###The Text

Here are a few quotes from Miller's piece:

> Yet there he was, a duck-faced teenager staring at his bathroom mirror, smart phone in hand. What this had to do with how much he loved worshiping Jesus was a mystery to me.

Let me provide a possibility: the subject of the selfie was inserting himself into the story he was telling. In his update he mentions an “intense time[s] of worship” and by presenting this text with his photo he is including himself and connecting himself with a communal experience of spirituality. Some folks call it “doing church” but you probably have your own language for it.

This kid was connecting with something bigger than himself. I only wish he had felt comfortable to take the selfie while at church instead of later. Maybe if our church leaders could get their heads out of their asses kids would feel comfortable expressing themselves in the languages they best understand.

> This is the world in which we live, the world of the selfie. The world where people take something that is not about them and make it about them through the lens of their camera.

People aren't making things about them, again, but they are inserting themselves into the story of the world around them. Some might call it collaborating with the narrative they see all around.

In fact, I've frequently told my wife and friends to stop taking pictures of objects, art and structures without people. People, in fact are the object of God's affection and our interest, and people are the interesting things in photographs.

Have you ever sat through a slide show of photos from a vacation? Depending largely on the ability of the photographer it can really be terrible - primarily because looking at bad photos of beautiful things is boring.

Now, even with the worst photos (blurry, poorly lit, infuriatingly framed - all of it), seeing people you love and recognize in different contexts is **wonderful**. It provides context for us, helps us imagine what their trip might have been like, and better helps us imagine the interesting and beautiful things they might have experienced.

> Grown men pose with their best “Blue Steel” smolder while the tip of Paris’s breath-taking Eiffel Tower protrudes from the side of their heads like a tiny, awkwardly placed steel horn.

“Grown men” seems like an insult, and Miller is referencing [Zoolander](http://letterboxd.com/film/zoolander/), but I'm not sure what he is getting at. Perhaps only “Not grown men“ should take selfies? But then this:

> Teenage girls attempt their cutest look while a singular stone column of Rome’s ancient, awe-inspiring Colosseum is barely visible in the background.

So, grown-ups and teenagers should not take selfies, at least not in front of interesting historical and architectural objects. I can understand where Miller is coming from here, I too love interesting historical and architectural objects, but if you want to look at photos of them there are [tons](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1196&bih=1342&site=imghp&tbm=isch&q=eiffel+tower&spell=1&sa=X&ei=05mXU4baA8jHoATuyYCgCw&ved=0CBsQvwUoAA) [available](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1196&bih=1342&site=imghp&tbm=isch&q=eiffel+tower&spell=1&sa=X&ei=05mXU4baA8jHoATuyYCgCw&ved=0CBsQvwUoAA#q=roman+coliseum&spell=1&tbm=isch). And I don't think the two groups of people he's generalizing about could take "better" photos of these things.

So, what is really going on here? Does Miller just long for better photographs? Here is where things get interesting. Selfies aren't photographs! Well, of course they are, but [Mike Rugnetta suggests that they are actually closer to a status update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j7SIxMGj5Q) than a photograph. They are a way we can say, "I am here, in this moment". They are in fact a way to be **present** in a [language familiar to many although not all](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1co.9.19-23.esv).

My best guess is that Miller is actually "preaching to the choir" of people that agree with him. I can imagine friends and church leaders reading this and lambasting youth culture, taking on the mantle of "anti-selfies", even declaring this stuff from their pulpit.

I can imagine, and have experienced, situations where church leadership drew misguided conclusions when interpreting culture through the lens of their own world view and background. More than once I've heard people talk to crowded rooms of young people, telling them to throw away particular music or dress differently or to behave in a particular way so that they could better conform to what the speaker thought best. 

I'd even agree that there is an interesting focus in this misdirection. Let's be less self-involved, absolutely! I just don't think this particular thing is a useful example or even a problem to fix. I think it's simply another instance of misunderstanding.

James Franco writes in his [NYTimes op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/arts/the-meanings-of-the-selfie.html?_r=0)

> ...in a visual culture, the selfie quickly and easily shows, not tells, how you’re feeling, where you are, what you’re doing.

I don't think the author would suggest we stop communicating with friends and family. Is it so ridiculous to think of selfies as a way to communicate one's status to a larger group? I know my experience with my son is that by taking pictures (frequently pictures with our [heads mushed together](http://instagram.com/p/pHHJ98n_Pn/) in our best selfie) I can tell the story of the things we're doing and how he is growing to a larger group of people than time would allow for phone calls or even text messages.

Miller continues:

> This selfie type of worship constantly tries to infiltrate our churches, causing us to value sentiment over substance, emotional hype over emotional health, or musical preference over meaningful proclamation.

I like most of the ideas in this paragraph, but I'm not sure how this relates to the selfie. Miller doesn't really draw an argument for us to consider, and the easy argument that selfies are simply self-involvement is also similarly refuted.

> This is neither done by singing about ourselves, nor obsessing over our preferential feelings.

Likewise, I very much agree with the sentiment here but am having a hard time seeing how this relates to selfies in any meaningful way. So frequently selfies are an expression meant for the audience.

Selfies very *infrequently* are beautiful photographs for the subject to cherish, rather a way of communicating with an audience of fans, followers and friends about what is going on around us. It is, in fact, not always a way to give something to ourselves, but a way to give a piece of ourselves to others.

That starts to sound pretty familiar when were talking about Jesus. If we look, even just a little, underneath the surface of this cultural act I think we'll see something generous and wonderful. As a result of considering this I think I'll start taking more selfies as I consider not only what I want to photograph, but also what my friends and family might like to see, because I love them and want to be generous with them.

> This is neither done by singing about ourselves, nor obsessing over our preferential feelings.

The reality of the selfie as it relates to modern culture is that selfies aren't for the subject, they are for the audience. In the initial example the student is describing his experience and then aligning himself with that experience with the picture. He's taking a stand publicly, proclaiming where he is at, [“...so I'll stand, with arms high and heart abandoned"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAQ61KH7qRc) style.

This is very much about him as he relates to God and the church, and about his "preferential feelings" about how to declare his allegiance, so while I agree that selfie culture is those things, I think it's short-sighted to think it's not so much else or that those things are inherently wrong or misguided when connected to corporate worship. 

> When the content of our songs and prayers are saturated with me-centered themes and thoughts, we are buying into the lie that worship is about us. 

By these standard, the way [Jesus teaches us to pray](https://bible.com/59/mat.6.9-13.esv) seems pretty "me-centered". In the Psalms we also see this "me-centered" language. Here's some choice parts form [Psalm 92](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/psa.92.esv)

> For you, O Lord , have made **me** glad by your work; at the works of your hands **I** sing for joy.

> But you have exalted **my horn** like that of the wild ox; you have poured over **me** fresh oil.

> **The righteous** flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

From certain vantage points, David seems pretty self-involved.

Miller concludes:

> May we all resist the temptation to fill the frame with our face, but rather fill our minds with his eternal glory, and never stop repeating the refrain of John 3:30

Miller totally makes my point for me. Just as John gets included in Jesus' story I think when we reconsider selfies and what they are adding to the narrative of our lives, we'll start to see things through each other's eyes and start thinking in terms of the collective rather than the individual.

Which, of course, is what Jesus has always wanted.
