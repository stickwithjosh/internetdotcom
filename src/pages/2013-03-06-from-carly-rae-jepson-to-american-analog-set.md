title: "From Carly Rae Jepson to American Analog Set"
---
Late on Monday evening [Jason Kottke linked to a mashup of Carely Rae Jepson and Nine Inch Nails](http://kottke.org/13/03/call-me-maybe-mashed-up-with-nins-head-like-a-hole). Predictably, it was terrific. The next day a bunch of my friends on social-music-streaming-service [Rdio](http://rdio.com) had added various Nine Inch Nails albums to their collection.

Every couple of months [Merlin Mann](http://merlinmann.com) mentions [The Aviator (2004)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aviator_(2004_film)). So far, each time he has mentioned it I end up downloading and watching the film.

Just a few minutes ago I got a notification from [Bandsintown](http://www.bandsintown.com/) that Pinback was going to be playing in Orlando. Bandsintown tracks your music listening against your location, does some math based on what other people listen to and presents you with shows they think you might be interested in. They knew I liked [American Analog Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Analog_Set), whom I haven't listened to basically since using Rdio for music full-time maybe two years ago and [suggested Pinback based on that knowledge](http://cl.ly/image/2E3w1N0d391y). I won't be going to the Pinback show, but seeing that I was "tracking" American Analog Set, I was reminded how much I love their music and added their discography to my Rdio account and linked to the song 'Punk as Fuck' [on my twitters](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/309341045479579648).

I'm super interested in finding ways to track bumps in popularity of various media in connection with their mentions and connections with new pieces of art. 

Surely at least tracking seeds or downloads of torrents over time would reveal interesting data in the aggregate that could help bands / film makers / artists identify cool or useful mentions.

Or maybe not.

UPDATE: It's worth noting that I've listened to the song "The Postman" from [my favorite American Analog Set album](http://rd.io/x/QFF1PkKlgw) 10 times so far.
