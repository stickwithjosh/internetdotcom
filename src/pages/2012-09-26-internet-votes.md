I totally forgot to mention that [Fight for the Future](http://fightforthefuture.org) launched [Internet Votes](http://internetvotes.org) yesterday as a part of National Voter Registration Day.

If you're not yet registered to vote, this website will make it relatively painless. One thing we've absolutely found is that politicians are much more likely to respond to citizens that are actively involved in the political process. Help us change the world, one step at a time.
