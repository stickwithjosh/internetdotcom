 > My recommendation: if you&#8217;re itching to preorder one of the new Kindles and absolutely can&#8217;t wait until the reviews are out, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007OZNZG0/?tag=marcoorg-20">go with the Paperwhite Wi-Fi with ads</a>.

Frequently, people who write for the internet share links to items available on Amazon with an additional part of the url that tells Amazon who sent the shopper. It's win-win-win, the writer gets a kick back from Amazon (the higher priced the item is, the larger the kick back), the readers get easy to purchase items and Amazon gets a new purchase.

Today I saw [Marco Arment](http://marco.org) post [the above quote](http://www.marco.org/2012/09/06/kindle-paperwhite-announced) along with one of these referral links (he even went out of his way to disclose that he would make a small amount of money because of the link). Later today [MG Siegler quoted Arment](http://parislemon.com/post/31011984070/which-kindle-paperwhite-to-buy) deliberately leaving Arment's referral link intact so that Marco would still make money from any purchases made via that link. Super great, and Siegler even mentioned it:

 > (By the way, that’s Marco’s affiliate link not mine. He’s a hard-working developer. Throw the guy a bone.)

Awesome. Even better? John Gruber quoted the same bit. Guess what he also did. That's right, [Gruber also kept Arment's referral code in the link](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/09/06/which-kindle).

I love it when people share the love in small ways like this. I already enjoy Gruber and Siegler's writing, but today then went above and beyond. Well done fellas.
