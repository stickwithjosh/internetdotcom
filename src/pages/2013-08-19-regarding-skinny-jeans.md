title: "Regarding skinny jeans"

I want it documented that there is a divide in the format and variety of skinny jeans.

Up until a certain (tightness), skinny jeans are made up of the same materials as other sorts of jeans. They are stiff, inflexible and can be hard to ride a bike in.

HOWEVER there is a magical moment where the manufacturers start using some blend of stretchy material. I don't know what it is[1], but the Levi's 510s have it and it is awesome.

Wearing relatively fashionable pants that basically feel like sweat pants is awesome. Hooray.

1. Actually, after a small bit of research involving Google it seems to be 2% Elastane mixed in with the cotton.
