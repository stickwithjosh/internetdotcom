I just stumbled[1] upon the news that [Sasha Baron Cohen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacha_Baron_Cohen) is going to be playing Freddie Mercury in an [upcoming film focusing on Queen's early years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(film)#Portrayal_in_film_and_television).

I'm surprised and intrigued by the choice, but I think the most interesting part is that the other members of the band were stalled and felt uncomfortable with a Queen / Mercury biopic until [Sasha Baron Cohen said he was interested](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/sacha-baron-cohen-is-perfect-to-play-1101423). They think he's perfect for the role, which makes me even more excited about the possibility.


1. By "stumbled" I mean I was eavesdropping on a conversation wherein the accountant for the local caf√© I frequent was talking up Cohen's film [The Dictator](http://letterboxd.com/film/the-dictator-2012/) but was having trouble remembering his name, so I was reading his Wikipedia article. I never actually interjected help after he landed on calling him "Borat".
