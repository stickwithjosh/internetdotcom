title: "FOOD TO EAT SOME TIME"
---
As is [frequently the case](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/83826806584/eating-off-menu), I've been low-carbing it to try and lose some weight and get some of my eating habits in order. Here's the short list of things I would like to eat very much, some day when I can trust myself a little better with food. Lot of similarity to [this list from 2011](http://shirt.joshuablount.com/posts/2011/things-i-would-eat-my-day/).

* **Ice cream:** A whole pint. Probably [Ruby Jewel](http://www.rubyjewel.com/) Salted Caramel.
* **Biscuits:** At this point, any biscuit. Specifically? Breakfast sandwich at [Tilt](http://tiltitup.com), and The Chatfield from [Pine State](http://www.pinestatebiscuits.com). 
* **Popcorn:** With butter, and maybe some reese's pieces while watching a movie.
* **Milkshake:** From [Dick's Kitchen](http://www.dkportland.com) - Yes of course I would get a burger and fries also. Don't be ridiculous.
* **Brownies:** Warm, maybe in a bowl with some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. 
* **Apple Fritter**: From [Blue Star](http://www.bluestardonuts.com/)

I've noticed this time that my appetite has all but disappeared compared to what it once was. I'm sure this has something to do with chemistry or whatever, but you'll have to talk to someone else to get anything beyond anecdotal data.
