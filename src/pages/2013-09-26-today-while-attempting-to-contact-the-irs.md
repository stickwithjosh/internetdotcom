Today I needed to call the IRS (and explain why they don't have their money yet, and promise them they will get it eventually).

1. **40 minutes**: I started calling on my walk in from the office, but my headphones disconnected the call when I sat down because they are dumb iPhone headphones that only last me a few months.
2. **35 minutes**: I called back again, same headphones disconnected the call. Got smart and put my phone in my shirt pocket when I called back. It's worth pointing out that my headphones also decided I would rather be listening to the latest [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w/138). My headphones were right.
3. **47 minutes**: This time, as far as I can tell, the person who answered my call at the IRS actually hung up on me. There was some beeping and stuttering in the hold music, a brief pause, then the three quick beeps indicating   
4. **77 minutes**: This time, after holding the now customary 40 or so minutes, I spoke to someone and explained my situation. They were incredibly hard to understand and spoke very slowly, but eventually we understood each other to our mutual satisfaction. Iâ€™m no longer in risking jail time for avoiding a tax bill.

199 minutes. 3.3 hours.
