title: "On owning your stuff (and how it can be a blessing and a curse)"

Keeping your stuff alive on the internet is hard.

###Before the handshake
When I first really got engaged with the internet it was 1995. I was enthralled at the massive amount of information about anything I could think of, at what seemed like impossible speed. It seemed too good to be true, so I assumed it was.

I spent maybe the next three years attempting to catalog everything I found that was interesting. I printed, I saved to stacks and stacks of floppies, I started learning scripting in order to make it easy to pull all of the cool stuff I found published out there to my local hard disk and zip disks, all fueled by the fact that I had no promise that it would continue to exist.

###The Handshake™

Eventually I learned that my capacity to archive the entire internet was only going to frustrate me. I started to trust this unspoken agreement that things, generally, would continue to exist in approximately the same way they exist now [at approximately the same URI/L](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html).

As the web itself and the technology we use to build the web have matured, there has been a bit of an unspoken agreement. People that create and do things on the web have been assuming that stuff will be around for the foreseeable future.

###Nothing lasts forever, particularly if you lose control

In more recent times, as I watch companies, tools and products I love come and go I've realized that the only way to maintain things myself is to maintain control.

Of course, this doesn't really solve the problem for non-me people, but easy answers are usually only one or the other. It's fine that I can jostle and move content between various platforms and services, maintaining links and helping things continue to function over the years, but what about my brother or dad? Who is going to maintain things for them? Or convince them that there is some value in maintaining all of that data?

###What I want to do

* As someone that make things others put their stuff into, I need to do everything I can to maintain their stuff. I mean it. For real.
* Owning your stuff means being a steward, and not everyone is up for that
* Owning your stuff means learning, that can be really awesome if you are interested

###Postscript

I wrote most of this months ago, here are a few random links that inspired my thinking:

* [Contents Magazine: Special Report #1: Data Protection](http://contentsmagazine.com/data)
* [Shane Hudson on deleting content](http://www.shanehudson.net/2013/09/19/stop-deleting-content)
* [Editorially's (RIP) post on maintaining revisions in their application](http://blog.editorially.com/post/61596307927/saving-your-work-in-more-ways-than-one)
* Also friend and developer [Chloe Weil](http://chloeweil.com/) has been [talking about maintaining her own stuff](http://chloeweil.com/blog/our-ragged-history) for a long time. Here's a quote from her post on [building Twitter posting into her blog](http://chloeweil.com/blog/hipster), so that the original data lives on a site she controls instead of the other way around: 

> There are several [notable reasons](https://indiewebcamp.com/why) why people would choose to [own their data](http://tantek.com/2011/010/b1/owning-your-data). Personally, I felt liberated by the broader idea that services like Twitter, Facebook and whatever comes along in the future would be representations of me, rather than “me, elsewhere.” I hide in plain sight on web-based services by obfuscating my identity through a hilarious avatar, by using a different poorly-considered, rarely-duplicated handle for each account, and by avoiding amalgamating a community (“friends”, followees, connections, basically). I’m a serial late adopter because the idea that these things are me makes me uneasy.
