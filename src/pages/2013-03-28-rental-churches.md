title: "Rental churches"

So, weâ€™ve successfully moved to Portland, Oregon. It has been approximately 2 weeks (and much more complicated than we initially guessed). You can see more about our adventures [in these short videos](http://joshplusmelissa.com).

We've been visiting churches (2-3 a weekend typically) trying to find a new place to call home. We've experience loads of wonderful spaces and people, but all but one are renting their space.

I'm not sure what the reasons are, but this seems fairly typical in larger cities. Modern, current, or just plain newer churches that are growing end up renting space from older more established churches (either that are in decline or don't use that space in the evening, etc). Another church just uses meeting space in a local hotel.

I'm not sure how I feel about this, but I wanted to document noticing it. It seems like there might be a correlation to the worldwide trend of [young adults staying home longer](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/apr/15/twentysomethings-staying-at-home-social-trends). It might just be connected to the Stumptown desire of reuse and conservation (why build or own when you can repurpose?)
