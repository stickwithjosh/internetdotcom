title: "Parent hacks: Bluetooth while driving"
---
I‘ve been spending more time than usual driving my family to places too fair for transit lately. One of the problems with this is that I don't know where anything is so I need Google Maps to tell me what's up.

The audio instructions plus discretely having the map near the dashboard for a double-check every one in a while works perfectly, the problem being that I spend a lot of time interrupting my family and whatever music we have playing in the car with the frequent updates from Google Maps instructions - which they really have zero interest in.

Another recent thing is that I‘ve moved from using the Apple EarPods included with iPhone to a [set of bluetooth headphones](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AIRUOI8/?tag=hypotheticalp-20) perfect for both walking around and running.

What I soon realized is that by keeping one earbud in my ear while driving I could:

* Get the directions I needed
* Keep them from annoying my family while making them clearly audible to me
* Not have my phone tied to the audio cable in the ZipCar (thus making it easy to stow or plug into a battery backup because of the battery-hungry GPS work the phone is doing)
* Allow Melissa to DJ our ride so that I didn't have to (dangerously) fiddle with my phone or tell her what to play

Wins all around, and the only downside I've noticed is that my particular bluetooth headphones what seems like a long time to power down.



***Disclaimer:*** I don't know what the rules are for your state, consult someone else for the legality of wearing headphones in one ear while driving.
