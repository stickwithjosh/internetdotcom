Today I had an idea, it went from that to a slightly more fleshed out idea in about forty-five minutes. Introducing [Me Right Now](http://www.merightnow.net).

It's just a short podcast where I ask friends what they're doing. I have no idea if I'll ever do it again, but this was fun. Let me know what you think about [the first episode](http://www.merightnow.net/episodes/2015/1/9) and thanks to Eric, Alyssa and Nathanial for being good sports.
