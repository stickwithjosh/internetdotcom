title: "An iPad for every home"

When the iPad was initially announced in January 2010 at an Apple Press Event I remember thinking that every home would have one. It seemed like a terrific device to share and pass, and I wondered how long it would be until their was some sort of users or accounts attached to the device so that you could switch between sets of apps or different email accounts or generally different people. I thought it would just be a matter of time.

We skipped the first generation but picked up the iPad 2 when it was released the following year. After everything shook it, it turned out to mostly be a game machine for Conor and a Netflix machine for Melissa, so I treated myself to the third generation iPad the following year.

Now Apple has released a second size and we've got one on the way (downgrading the older second generation to a toddler only machine). Three iPads in our house, three humans.

I know that every home won't come to the same conclusion, but it seems to have happened for us. The iPad has proven itself useful enough that all three of us have one (and after Melissa and I upgrade our phones later this month to the iPhone 5, all three of us will have a iPhone sized device). I still feel like offering accounts on the larger iOS devices would make them more useful, but I'm less and less convinced that Apple will ever add the functionality.
