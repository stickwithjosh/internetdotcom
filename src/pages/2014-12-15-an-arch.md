There is a trajectory in my life.

I’m hoping it’s toward justice, toward inclusion, toward wholeness, toward humanity and the divine all at the same time. I feel like that’s the way I’m going.

I don’t recognize it enough because she’s so close, but I’m really grateful [my partner](https://twitter.com/melissablount) is on the same trajectory. She’s frequently the one there to correct or advise me, to lead me in a way we’ve verbally and subconsciously found together.

I do not know where I would be without her, but I don’t think it would be here.

I like it here.
