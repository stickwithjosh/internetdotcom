We've mostly decided on a church. It's named [The Groves](http://thegroveschurch.com) but this isn't about them.

One of the larger churches in Portland is [Solid Rock](http://www.ajesuschurch.org/) (Who sometimes call themselves "a jesus church" which seems like a weird thing to do. One name is probably plenty). They seem nice, have dope music, but are a little too patriarchal for us.

When we visited i accidentally left Melissa's scarf (she was picking up the kid, so grabbing our stuff was my job). It was a relatively nice scarf that her grandmother purchased for her on a trip to the UK.

Melissa called and emailed SR for weeks attempting to get a response. She couldn't get anyone to confirm or deny the existence of a scarf in their lost and found, much less help here get it back. Their only recommendation was to return and ask at the desk.

So, last night, I was headed back to Solid Rock. I enjoyed the service I went to earlier, and wanted a chance to her the lead pastor teach (he was away the week we visited). Conor and Melissa were having a relatively lazy Sunday evening so it was my job to hit up the lost and found and get back her scarf also.

When I got there I headed to the well-marked informatino desk, got a scarf from the person behind the counter, and headed to the adjacent room to get some coffee. The place was hopping, so getting coffee and attempting to go sit down took some time and the band had already started as I was walking upstairs to the secondary seating.

Before I got up there I heard a gruff voice call out, "Excuse me sir-can I get you to check your bag?". It was one of the security dudes, presumably following their typical security protocol.

After confirming he wanted me to check my relatively large Chrome messenger bag (containing the scarf, my camera and a whole lot of air) I made a snap judgement to bail. I was already a little annoyed at the whole process, and the idea of surrendering my belongings to this church that had been so unhelpful before seemed like a bad idea.

I'm sure they have their reasons for asking people to check bags, and I understand it must be complicated to satisfy requests about lost and found items when you are operating out of multiple locations, and I'm sure Solid Rock are doing good in the community, but all of this reminded me how important every interaction you have with other humans can be. I hope I can remember the frustration I felt last night in the future.
