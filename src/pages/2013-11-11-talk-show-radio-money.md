title: "Talk Show Radio Money"
---
Today I was sitting at my local (were "my local" is equal to the diner near my office) enjoying some mopey-day-carbs and half-listening to the talk radio that was playing.

The person hosting the show suggested that gold was taking a value dive - of course if you waited just thirty minutes he was going to recommend either buying all the gold you can or avoiding it like the plague. Keep this station dialed in to find out!

Someone called in with a question which wasn't incredibly interesting (they had $30k and we're looking for a high-yield be easy access sort of safe place to hold that money. Spoiler: There isn't a good combination of those two things, you'll need to accept a lower return or higher risk or lack of access for a larger period of time).

The thing I noticed is that at the end of the hosts recommendations he paused to congratulate the caller. “You must be good with your money” he said, having just educated him on savings 101.
