I [mentioned this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/360290036723367938) earlier, but I think I'd like to work on a modern, local, “newspaper”.

In my mind this looks like two employees / owners (myself as a developer and a journalist?) to start with, perhaps expanding an editorial team as time and funds would allow.

I would build things to make publishing news easy, journalist would write (record?) news. Perhaps we could find a way to subsidize it with some combination of paid members / patronage and ads.

I think the best examples of what I'd be interested in participating in is something like [Bike Portland](http://bikeportland.org) but less niche.


It seems like it would be critical to include some amount of  volunteer submissions, maybe with friends that watch Reddit, mailing lists, etc doing a broader topic while still local site would work.
