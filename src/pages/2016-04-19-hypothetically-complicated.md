As is my want, I've spent the last week or two devouring all of the videos in these playlsits: [US History](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtMwmepBjTSG593eG7ObzO7s), [Word History](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9) and [World History 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNjasccl-WajpONGX3zoY4M). These are ~15 minute videos that go over periods and pieces of history in a way that really vibes with me, focused less on wars and dates and more on ideas, feelings and world views. Very cool.

##Crash Course

Those videos are part of a thing called [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse), which I suppose is also trying to do this same thing for other topics ([Philosphy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR) and [Biology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF) as examples). I'm with this, so I threw a few bucks to them on [Patreo](https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse). But this is not about that.

##Vlog Bros.

Part of the reason I started watching these videos is after becoming interested in the [videos of the two founders](https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers). The publish videos to each other as a pretense to post videos, which is precisely the kind of thing I would like, but didn't really catch on the first time.

I know what you're thinking, “When was the first time?” or “What is the point of this information?”. The first time I watched some of the “Vlog Brothers” (yes, really) videos was for research when we were reviewing [The Fault in Our Stars](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/episode/fault-our-stars) which was based on a book of the same name by one of the brothers, [Mr. John Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Green_(author)).

##Hypothetical

As far as the point of this, when trying to find that episode of [Hypothetical](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com) that I just mentioned. When considering the many ways I could find that particular page on the internet, I realized that I could probably google, “[hypothetical fault in our stars](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hypothetical+fault+in+our+stars)”. Upon realizing this, before I searched for that, I searched [for this](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=hypothetical+die+hard).

So, in conclusion, if you Google, “hypothetical die hard” you get the podcast my pal [Carlo](http://twitter.com/cgsimone) and I do. This makes me so very happy that I no longer regret our podcast's name.
