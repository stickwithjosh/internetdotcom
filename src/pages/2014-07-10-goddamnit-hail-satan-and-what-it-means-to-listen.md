title: "Goddamnit, “Hail Satan” and what it means to listen"
---
My favorite album is named, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddamnit">Goddamnit</a>.” The punch, ferocity and passion in that set of songs helped me deal with the confusion of being in love with a person who was actively destroying an entire side of my personality more than a decade ago. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuHUyyhgspc&list=PL0A29AFF67176D4EB">The entire thirty-two minutes and forty two seconds</a> of it are perfect.

<p>One of my favorite songs has the lyric, “<a href="http://rock.rapgenius.com/The-mountain-goats-the-best-ever-death-metal-band-in-denton-lyrics#note-1231591">Hail Satan!</a>” which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_FNcW3GThY">I have shouted loudly at two Mountain Goats shows</a>. My eyes frequently tear up when listening to that song, considering when I’ve been misunderstood, or friends that have been robbed of their hopes, even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Memphis_Three">imprisoned for 18 years because they were different</a>.</p>

<p>I find no disconnect with these facts and the faith that is so central to my worldview. In fact, I’ve gleefully shouted, “Hail Satan!” while listening to <em>The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton</em> on my way to play music at a church.</p>

<p><strong>I should give other people that same space.</strong></p>

<p>Our differences and disagreements don’t mean that they are wrong or not trying. Not that we shouldn’t argue, not that I shouldn’t stand up for what I believe and stand against all the oppression and hate in the world, but that I should consider others’ humanity as much as my own. I should consider that they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Imagine_others_complexly">complex</a>, thoughtful and trying to be the best version of themselves.</p>

<p>Just because they are doing something or saying something I wouldn’t doesn’t mean everything about them is suddenly invalid, and frequently it’s that I just don’t understand <em>the why</em>.</p>

<p>When I talk and think about things with people I should consider their history and what it means to be having those conversations. Sometimes even entering into conversation about particular topics is an act of bravery and danger that I’m blissfully unaware of. I should ask questions and try my best not to assume I know what their answers will be. The onus is, and always will be, on me.</p>

<p>I love you, I’m sorry when I have had a hard time listening. <strong>I will try to do better</strong>. </p>
