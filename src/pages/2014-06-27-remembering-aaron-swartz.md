The film is a documentary about the life and work of [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com). Aaron was a talented programmer & technologist, an activist and a thoughtful human.

Aaron worked on many projects you might be familiar with, and I had followed his work for years before being introduced to him directly as a result of my work with [Fight for the Future](http://fightforthefuture.org) (a sister organization to [Demand Progress](http://www.demandprogress.org) which he founded).

Aaron was helpful in a few areas, but there is one story in particular that I wanted to document:

During the ramp up to the first large scale online protest we organized (we called it [American Censorship Day](http://americancensorship.net/) - which was a pre-cursor to the larger scale [protest on 1/18/2012](http://sopastrike.com/)) Aaron had been helpful debugging and testing some javascript that we were giving people to put on their own websites and blogs that would show their users a banner proclaiming their support and asking friends to take action.

As the work got more stressful I had the second of what I now know was a depressive episode as a result of my [now diagnosed bipolar disorder](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/83962672352/dealing-with-diagnosis). I suddenly dropped out of contact a few days before the protest and left my team and the last minute details undone.

Aaron was able to jump in and literally fix my code when I was too depressed to even look at my computer. When I was feeling better, about 12 hours before the protest I saw his changes and was able to tie up some last minute things and the day was a huge success leading to the protest in January and to our success over SOPA / PIPA.

I did not know Aaron well – I almost feel embarrassed commenting on his work & this story is small, but I know so many friends that have similar stories about how Aaron's legacy and help have been fundamental to their own work.

What happened to Aaron is a tragedy that even now hasn't been answered for. The [CFAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act) (the law under which [Aaron was prosecuted and harassed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Aaron_Swartz)) hasn't been updated to stop injustices like this (there was an effort known as [Aaron's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act#Aaron.27s_Law_proposal) but as [I noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/482611909628137473) it seems like [Oracle / Larry Ellison have stopped that effort](http://o.canada.com/technology/swartz-doc-director-oracle-and-larry-ellison-killed-aarons-law)).

I would encourage you to watch the film. It felt like it honored Aaron's life and legacy. I would also encourage you to pay attention to the politicians named and interviewed in the film (most notably Senators [Ron Wyden](http://www.wyden.senate.gov) and [Elizabeth Warren](http://warren.senate.gov), and Representative [Zoe Lofgren](http://lofgren.house.gov)).

Although government interests frequently seem to align more with corporate backers than the citizens they serve, there are people willing to work for the greater good. Support them, work with them and hold them accountable when they make poor decisions.
