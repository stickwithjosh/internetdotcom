It's been about two years since [the last time I documented the podcasts I listen to](joshuablount.com/posts/2011/podcasts-i-pay-attention-to/). Things have shifted around quite a bit - although there are some constants.


* [The Talk Show](http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/) - Grubes has only gotten more and more compelling, as has thisâ€”the audio companion to [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net)
* [DecodeDC](http://www.decodedc.com/) - Incredibly interesting discussions related to politics at the national level. I only wish this was produced more frequently.
* [Nothing to Write Home About](http://www.ntwha.com/) - Matt Pryor (Get Up Kids, New Amsterdams) interviews other friends, musicians and songwriters? Yes, please.
* [You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com/) - My favorite 'comedy' 'podcast'
* [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w) - Merlin talks about work with some guy that doesn't seem very interested 
* [Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/) - Merlin talks with [Melissa's](http://twitter.com/melissablount) favorite person to talk to on Twitter
* [Unprofessional](http://www.muleradio.net/unprofessional/) - Surprise hit, I especially enjoyed the episodes with [Christa Mrgan](http://www.muleradio.net/unprofessional/5/) and [Amy Jane Gruber](http://www.muleradio.net/unprofessional/1/)
* [The Incomparable](http://5by5.tv/incomparable) - A better version of my humble [Hypothetical Podcast](http://hypotheticalpodcast.com)
* [The Grapes of Rad](http://www.grapesofrad.com/) - Topical comedy? I'm not even sure how to classify this one. Be sure and checkout [the two-part](http://www.grapesofrad.com/2012/10/the-grapes-of-rad-193-david-bazan-pt-1/) [talk with](http://www.grapesofrad.com/2012/10/the-grapes-of-rad-193-david-bazan-pt-2/) with [David Bazan](http://davidbazan.com)
* [The /Filmcast](http://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/slashfilmcast/) - Weekly movie reviews from a panel of knowledgable hosts
* [Identical Cousins](http://identicalcousins.net/) - Development and design discussion from Brent and Michael Simmons
* [Core Intuition](http://www.coreint.org/) - My favorite development focused podcast, super glad Daniel Jalkut and Manton Reece have started recording more frequently.
