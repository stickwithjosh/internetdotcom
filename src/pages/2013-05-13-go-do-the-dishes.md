title: "Go do the dishes"
---
As a developer, I frequently find myself at an impasse.

Today, I was working on some final bugs for a client. I wasn't the first nerd to tackle this codebase and it really shows in the complexity of the hacks and weirdness that are involved in even getting minor things fixed.

Noticing that I was staring, motionless for about 5 minutes at my laptop, I did what any sensible developer should do in that situation.

I got up, and did the dishes.

There are so many great things about doing the dishes:

1. Manual labor allows the parts of your body that remain dormant while sitting at a desk to get moving. 
2. There's something nice about warm water, I'm unclear if it's related to circulation or something else, but it makes me feel better in general.
3. Stepping way from a problem that is plaguing you frequently allows your subconscious to work on the problem when you are away.
4. If none of the other items are useful to you, at least at the end you have clean dishes, which is awesome.

Luckily, [my beloved coworking joint](http://collectiveagency.co) has no shortage of dishes to wash most of the time. Sadly, I don't work from home much any more so my family doesn't receive the benefit of mid-day breaks.
