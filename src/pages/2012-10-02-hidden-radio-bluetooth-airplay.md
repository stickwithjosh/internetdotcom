Recently I purchased the [Hidden Bluetooth Speaker](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2107726947/hidden-radio-and-bluetooth-speaker) via Kickstarter. It came in today, and it's OK - although since it's our first bluetooth speaker I discovered something really annoying.

####Bluetooth sucks for families.

I'm not sure what the numbers are, but I'd guess that most people live with at least one other person. In our house I live with my wife and our two year-old son. Between the three of us we have about 6 devices that could put out audio to this tiny speaker.

You've probably already guessed the problem if you live in a similar situation - the only way to switch the input device of a bluetooth speaker (when both devices are in range) is to disconnect the previous device.

As an example, I set up my wife's phone to use the speaker and started playing one of her favorite albums from [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/) trough the speaker. She left the room (with her phone) and I discovered that I wasn't able to reconnect my phone to the speaker before I disconnected her phone.


####AirPlay

In stark contrast is Apple's [AirPlay](http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay). To get started, the only requirement is that you're on the same wifi network as the AirPlay device. In order to "take over" the speaker from the last person that was playing something, you simply select it and AirPlay defers to the last device that choose it as an output.

One of the coolest things about AirPlay is when you have an Apple TV and a group of friends sharing recently popular YouTube videos. The ease with which you can push video to the TV from your phone, and change the person that currently is controlling the video is really remarkable - it feels like all of the technology is getting out of your way as fast as it can.

####I just want things to work

I get that Bluetooth is an open standard, and that it will "work" with more devices, but I'm more interested in what will work for my family. I didn't even mention the multiple times that the bluetooth audio reciever dropped out altogether. I'm very happy to trade cost (most AirPlay powered solutions are more expensive because the technology has to be licensed from Apple) and "openness" for functionality.
