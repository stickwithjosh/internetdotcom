Many times I'm self-aware to a fault. Being what I like to call a party-core introvert means spending loads of time thinking about how people interpret me and why I behave in the various ways I do.

Frequently [my darling wife](http://melissablount.com) has the unfortunate task of listening to me pontificate on the state of my life and how it relates to the universe. Most of the time I'm just bullshitting, but she's patient with me and it helps me process things.

One recent monologue was related to our relationship. I was considering how we both feel like we've grown more in love over time, and how that isn't always the case.

I think Melissa and I are growing together because we are becoming more thoughtful and considerate over time. For my part that means saying sorry earlier (and every once in a while not doing / saying the thing that I needed to apologize about). It also means that as we spend time together our thoughts about what sort of people we are becoming are shaped by our spouses desires and longings.

This isn't about always relinquishing my personality to become some ideal husband, but it's more about choosing a path that honors and respects her because we have a history of love and mutual admiration.

My advice? **Marry someone you are impressed with.**

Melissa is one of the smartest, most caring and beautiful friends I've ever had. Our relationship has made me the sort of person I am now, and most of the good things in my life have a direct line to her being involved.
