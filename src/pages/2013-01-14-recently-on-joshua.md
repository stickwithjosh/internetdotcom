A lot can happen in a week. Here’s a brief roundup of last week.

####Went dark again

I went [dark](http://joshuablount.com/posts/2010/ways-tell-im-not-feeling-well-mental-illness/) again. Probably related to anxiety about our upcoming move and being a little over tasked in general.

Long story short: Sometimes my brain goes into maintenance mode. This seems to occur every six months to a year in frequency for anywhere between two daysn and two weeks. Basically it seems like I suddenly require incredibly amounts of sleep (As much as twenty hours a day). I don’t have a diagnosis yet, but Melissa and I are starting to think it’s more chemcial than mental. I think it’s worth noting that I’m reasonably certain that this stuff isn’t related to depression in any way that I understand it.

At this point we’ve (well, really just Melissa) figured out that if I just sleep—a lot—that I don’t get as confused or feel very out of place. I’m probably about 80% at this point, which is about as good as anyone can ask for.

####Josh Plus Melissa moving to PDX video thing.

Yes, we’re moving. I feel like I’m talking about it constantly, but what are you going to do. We made a short video in an effort to find friends. So far we have identified one potential friend and a few spam bots:

Watch, share with friends, send them to [joshplusmelissa.com](http://joshplusmelissa.com), etc.

(Yes, I know there are like two minutes of darkness at the end, and no, I don’t plan on re-exporting it to fix that up. I consider this a mark of personal growth.)

####Melissa starts blogging, what?

I think related to the new year, [Melissa started writing](http://melissablount.com). She’s such a talented writer, I’m glad she’s doing this.

####Shorter, better, faster

* Published what might be [the most offensive episode of a Hypothetical Podcast](http://hypotheticalpodcast.com/post/40505109194/django-unchained-balls-make-me-sentimental) (our Django Unchained review) last night.
* I’ve got not one, but two other shows that are currently in the planning stages. Also what might turn into a recording project after we move.
* Our house was listed for about 24 hours before we got an offer. This happened very quickly and I am very very happy about it. Actual process will take quite a bit longer because… banks.
* Also, it seems like it’s the time of year for new projects—if you want to work with me on something interesting hit me up at [work@joshuablount.com](mailto:work@joshuablount.com) the year is already starting to fill up with cool stuff.
* I'd feel foolish if I didn't mention [Aaron's passing](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html). I feel almost equally as foolish mentioning it in this small stupid way. We only met a handful of times as a result of my [day job](http://fightforthefuture.org) but I was a total fan of his work and this particular piece of bad news hit me like a kick in the face.
