I just got in a twitter fight with my pal [Olivier](http://olivierlacan.com/). (So lame, I love Olivier!). We disagreed on a point he made here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>It bothers me how ubiquitous of a web service Gravatar is when it refuses to take my money to make people responsible for its maintenance.</p>&mdash; Olivier Lacan (@olivierlacan) <a href="https://twitter.com/olivierlacan/statuses/383665249809100800">September 27, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now, **Olivier has a point**. Gravatar is *super* ubiquitous with *very* little support. I can see how someone as smart as Olivier would be bothered by this. Totally fair.

My fundamental problem with his statement is that he indicates that Gravatar is **“refusing to take his money”** and that by taking his money someone would be **“responsible for its maintenance”**.

There is a cultural problem here among nerds of a certain flavor. We’ve all read that we are not Google's customer, we are in fact their product – and that by juxtaposition we are Apple's customer because we are giving them money. But I think we are making poor assumptions based on these ideas about what the customer / business relationship is.

An exchange of money does not ensure maintenance, support or responsibility on behalf of the person receiving the money. It just doesn't. You can pay a company for something, usually a product, and they might offer support, but there is very rarely any guarantee that anything will stay the same next month.


Plus, if things were really out of sorts, **they could just refund you**.

Examples are all over. I pay [Heroku](http://heroku.com) to host a few of my websites, but Salesforce could shut them down entirely with very little warning and my money would have very little effect over their business decisions. I pay [Rdio](http://rdio.cm) for that sweet, sweet, music but they could go away next month and I would have to use Spotify (like an animal).

These services are useful to me *in spite* of the risk I'm assuming by not being able to control them. With my money I am acknowledging the risk and the fact that their service is more useful to me than having full control over a similar (product, service, feature, etc).

I think largely **we have to make these decisions ourselves, weighing the costs**. In Gravatar's case you get pretty good avatars with very little work. The relative frustration with replacing Gravatar is low (in fact, it's likely that if they go away at some point there will be multiple services to replace them mirroring their API) and the ubiquity of use is high (at least with nerds). Win, win, win.

Now, if you were building a custom service that was only dealing with Gravatar and needed Gravatar to still be around to have success you'd be talking about an entirely different problem. I'd say you wouldn't want to depend on them, at least not before you had a conversation with someone at <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> to get an idea of their future road map and plans. Even having that, I'd doubt they'd be willing to promise or ensure their own stability for any significant period of time.

I think what all of this tells me is to embrace the chaotic nature of building things quickly on the web. Things break, relationships sour and products change. Staying nimble and moving quickly so that you can react to those changes seems like a much better plan than throwing money around hoping it will convince companies to adhere to your idea of what they should be doing.
