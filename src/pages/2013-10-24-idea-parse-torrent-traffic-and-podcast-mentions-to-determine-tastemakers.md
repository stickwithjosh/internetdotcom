When [Merlin Mann goes on a tear about The Aviator](http://5by5.tv/b2w/85) I always end up re-watching it.

Iâ€™d love to have some statistics that looked at seemingly random bumps in popularity of media on legal and near-legal networks and associated them with recommendations from independent podcasters and new fangled media.

Secondarily it might also be interesting to look at when in the cycle before a sequel (or new film from the same director comes out) that the previous movie gains traction. Did [Children of Men](http://imdb.com/title/tt0206634/) see a significant rise in activity months or weeks before [Gravity](http://imdb.com/title/tt1454468/) came out?

Bonus points: Find a way to make money by having studios and movie marketing companies pay for research on this stuff.
