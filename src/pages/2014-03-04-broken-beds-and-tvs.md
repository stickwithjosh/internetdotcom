title: "Broken beds and TVs."

When Melissa and I originally moved to Portland I spent a solid week putting IKEA furniture together. It was not a fun period of my life (and not super productive) and I committed to not doing that again.

Last week we moved to a new (very awesome) apartment. I knew ahead of time that I wanted to hire a company so they could break down and put back together our furniture. I also knew they are semi-pricey, so I spent the days before they came moving our stuff with a small wagon (five blocks is a lot slower on foot) so that when they came they could just move the big stuff.

The movers came and they went fast and hard getting our stuff in their truck. Things seemed like they would go very well. The person in charge told me they do this all the time and are very good at their job.

Surprisingly not only did they break my TV (you know, the one I researched for six months before purchasing? The one that isn't being manufactured anymore so it can't be replaced?) and the two pieces that I was most relieved to have someone else dealing with took entirely too long (probably 4 hours total for the two beds in and out) and I had to fix them myself afterward to make them safe after realizing they didn't understand how the IKEA slat system things work.

I have no moral or joke for this.
