It is really nice when people tell you they like your stuff directly.

I make stuff for publication seemingly all the time. I do an [infrequent podcast](http://hypotheticalpodcast.com) with my buddy [Carlo](http://twitter.com/cgsimone) about movies. Every sometime [Melissa](http://twitter.com/melissablount) and I record a video to tell friends and family how we're doing. We record [handfuls of our favorite songs](https://exceptafterc.bandcamp.com/) for people to listen to. This, not to mention [Instagram](http://instagram.com/stuckwithjosh), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stickwithjosh) and whatever other social internet thing I do to broadcast to the world.

I love doing this. I love the nature of many to one communication, how I can follow people (and not follow) on various services and enjoy what they are doing and making. The whole thing is great.

But there is this one problem.

I hate talking about the things I'm making.

If I were looking objectively at someone else, I would identify this problem. It's easy, if you are making a thing and publishing it you want other people to see / hear / consume it, you should tell them about it. You should do that frequently so they don't forget, once isn't enough.

Easy to understand, hard to feel comfortable with.

Although I'm pretty self-invovled, I feel so insufferably selfish when promoting something I've made. Even if I'm very proud of the thing I made it's hard to advocate for myself and try to draw others attention to what I'm doing. No matter how much I love it.
