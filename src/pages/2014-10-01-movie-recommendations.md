Today, my pal Winston asked for movie recommendations.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Ok, assume Freya and I have not seen a movie in the past 2 years. Whatâ€™s worth seeing? Foreign, indie, docs preferred.</p>&mdash; Winston the III (@suchwinston) <a href="https://twitter.com/suchwinston/status/517066641864421376">September 30, 2014</a></blockquote>

So [I](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/517068975222444032) [responded](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/517069039328174080) [with](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/517069060303892480) a [series](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/517069274074980352) of [tweets](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/517071956844109824) and [suggestions](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/517072679711436800).

I realize that my barrage of suggestions weren't that helpful, so [I made a list](http://letterboxd.com/stickwithjosh/list/the-last-two-or-so-years/) and sorted it according to my favorites. 

I also synthesized a smaller list based on Winston's ask for foreign, indie and documentaries. Two for each category:


#### Documentaries

* [The Punk Singer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1785612/)
* [Shut Up and Play the Hits](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2124908/)

#### Indie

* [In a World...](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294677/)
* [The Place Beyond the Pines](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1817273/)

#### Foreign

* [Reality](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1846487/)
* [Starbuck](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1756750/)
