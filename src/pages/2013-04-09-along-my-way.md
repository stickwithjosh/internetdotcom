Entrepreneurship is really about execution, so here's an app idea I had today.

I need an phone application that can give me a better view into new cities. I frequently know where I am (or at least my phone does) and I frequently know where I want to go (either an address or the name of a place) but I also frequently want something before I arrive at the new place.

Yesterday, I wanted to buy a pie on the way home. This morning I wanted a bagel on the way to work.

Typically, you would search near either your starting location or your destination to try and find something on your way. The problem with this is that you have to do the pattern matching to figure out if the (bagel or pie) is on your way.

We should use computers for this. Your preferred mapping application already knows the path you are planning on taking, it knows where the bagels and pies are (and Yelp knows if they are open), so why can't it tell you the (bagel or pie) that is closest to your path.

I've got other projects that haven't let me finish building my last app, so this is for grabs. Please build it soon, I'm hungry right now.
