title: "Getting Ready for a Phone Call"
---
I have a lot of phone calls - particularly when I'm in between projbects as I setup the next thing. Here are the things I do to get ready for a call, when I do all of these I feel pretty confident and together so I can focus on communicating clearly and don't feel rushed.

- 15 minutes before: Finish up any tasks you have currently open. Deploy, commit, save, etc and hide any windows that aren't relevant on your laptop.

- 10 minutes before: Go to the bathroom, grab a drink.

- 5 minutes before: Move your junk (laptop, paper, pen)to some place you can stand, plug in your headphones to the device you'll be talking on and start playing something to make sure they are connected.

- 1 minute before: Write down the name of the person you're speaking to, their title and the company they represent. Preferably on paper so you can ignore your laptop and it's glowing screen.
