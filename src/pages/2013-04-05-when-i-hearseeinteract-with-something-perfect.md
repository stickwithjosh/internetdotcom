There is this song called Constant Headache by a band named Joyce Manor. It is a perfect thing.

Somedays a perfect thing would make me want to make more things, some days a perfect thing scares me into not wanting to make things because I know it will never measure up.

I wonder if I can shift the balance to the former.
