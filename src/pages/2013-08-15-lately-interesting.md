Lately I've been way into

* Taking screenshots of websites from the command line with [webkit2png](http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/)

* [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) the CSS preprocessor (maybe more on this later)

* [Pain & Gain](http://letterboxd.com/film/pain-gain/)

* [Letterboxd's new "cloning" lists feature](http://news.letterboxd.com/post/58117468233/cloning). They basically implemented a really nice version of what [I outlined here](http://feedback.letterboxd.com/forums/136771-general/suggestions/3558703-some-standard-way-to-rank-a-series-of-films#comments) on their feature request forum. Any pro user can "clone" any list they find, make their own version (including changing order, adding, deleting, etc. Super great implementation including a really handsome icon.
* New [Hood Internet Mixtape](http://www.thehoodinternet.com/2013/08/mishka-presents-trillwave-3.html) (Trillwave #3). My favorite moment is around 27:50 but the whole thing is pretty terrific.

* [Paul Hammond on XOXO (from last year, but just re-read it and got excited again. Paul makes webkit2png also)](http://www.paulhammond.org/2012/xoxo/)

##Music Videos

I love music videos and live performance videos from bands. Here are a few I've been into lately.
