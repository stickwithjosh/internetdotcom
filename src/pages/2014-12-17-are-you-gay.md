title: "“Are you gay?”"
---
Today while walking a gentleman that appeared to be homeless asked me as I was passing him, “Hey, are you gay?”

Not the most unusual question for the neighborhood (I get called the f-word a few times a month in the few block radius around my office) so I wasn’t super surprised and responded, “Nope.” as I walked by.
I thought that was the end, but he decided to walk alongside me for a while. This is pretty unusual, has happened to me maybe once before in the past two years, and made me a tiny bit uncomfortable. Not a huge deal, just a touch more alert.

He went on to tell me that he didn’t care who I fucked, and talked at length about his destiny to be rich and the similarities between his story and the movie [The Pursuit of Happyness](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454921/). After that he returned to his interest in me and how that was OK with him before confirming, “You’re gay, right?”.

I responded, ”Nope. I’m married to a woman.” pretty curtly to which he exclaimed, “Thank god!”.

At this, the subject matter changed again to how hard his life is. “Portland, this is like a motherfuckin’ white-klan-state man. Shit is hard. But I’m going to be alright.”

He stopped walking and as I continue toward my lunch I told him, “Good luck.” which he seemed appreciative of even while I couldn’t help but feel [a little terrible about everything](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jas.2.16).
