My son, Conor, is three years old.

He's a touch obsessed with the conceptual idea of “bad guys” and “good guys”[1]. From what I can tell this started because one of the first films we saw in the movie theater together was [Wreck-It Ralph](http://letterboxd.com/film/wreck-it-ralph/), which features the conceptual idea of being a bad guy prominently.

Lately, as I watch him develop, I've started to realize that the juxtaposition and [“othering”](http://therearenoothers.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/othering-101-what-is-othering/) built into the idea of good guys and bad guys may be unintentionally harmful to the way he thinks about the world and making decisions.

When we identify someone else as a bad guy, we are assuming that they will make decisions that are harmful and destructive. By doing this, I think we're taking away a part of their humanity and their ability to make better, sometimes redemptive, choices.

Similarly, when we identify as good guys I think we stop being self-critical about our decisions and assume that they way *we* think and the way *we* act are the *right* ways, which upon reflection can often be false.

I've started to talk to Conor about this. I'm telling him that I think we can all make good and bad decisions, and that I don't believe in good guys or bad guys. I'm showing him that he needs to try his best to make good decisions for himself and for the people around him. 

We've even got a terrific example in Darth Vader, who is thematically the most iconic bad guy in Conor's life, but makes good decisions at the end of Return of the Jedi.

1. Later, hopefully, we'll start talking about how “guys” isn't a very helpful way to talk about humans who may be of any gender.
