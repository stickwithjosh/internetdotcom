[Marco Armnet](http://marco.org) has [finally announced his new project](http://www.marco.org/2012/10/11/the-magazine) perfectly titled [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/):

> The Magazine is for people who love technology, especially the internet, mobile, truly great personal computers, and related fields influenced by technology such as photography, publishing, music, and even coffee.

I was looking forward to [whatever Marco was planning](http://marcorumors.com/), and this is perfect. Do yourself a favor and pick it up on [the App Store today](http://itunes.apple.com/app/themagazine/id557744510).
