[These notes on the recording process from Mansions latest LP are wonderful](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mansions/doom-loop-recording-notes/10152016438393551).

> As you will see, the album was recorded for pennies and was primarily recorded in a studio apartment (rather than an actual studio), and I hope that helps inspire you to go make something of your own.

I think this all the time when friends and bands who are just getting started have spent time and cash traveling to far away studios to record. It seems like so much wasted energy and effort, when recording (at least getting guitar, keys and bass down) can be sooo cheap and provide a really terrific end result.

(Yes, I'm thinking about recording and songwriting lately, still haphazardly working on a project I hope to publish later this year. Songwriting fragments are almost always published at [Soundcloud](soundcloud.com/stickwithjosh))
