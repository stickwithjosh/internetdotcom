Today I shipped the first thing to our Portland, OR address.

In this case It's a new iMac for [Melissa](http://melissablount.com) (who has been without a computer since I gave away her last laptop). Nothing too exciting, but we were waiting on purchasing it so we wouldn't have to move it across the country.

Yesterday was the four week marker. 28 days from our move. That makes today 27. Less than four weeks.

I couldn't even remember the right way to type in an apartment number on the address2 line of a shipping information box.
