title: "Rdio should add a block button"
---
My pals at [Rdio](http://rdio.com) released some [cool new features and updates to their service today](http://blog.rdio.com/us/2014/09/come-as-you-are-an-evolved-rdio.html).

I'm into the new features, they center primarily on the Stations and Recommendations pieces, but one thing that I really would love is a “block” button.

When I'm listening to music of a certain genre, frequently Rdio will suggest stuff I don‘t like. Not a huge deal, I just skip it (and the service documents that I didn't like it or something).

The real trouble is for stuff that I know I don't like, or things that actively upset me / don't ever want to hear. The only thing two that come to mind right now are R Kelly (because [he is a rapist](http://jezebel.com/what-we-absolutely-must-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-r-1484481115)) and Saves the Day (much less drastically I only like one song in their entire catalog and it comes up frequently as a recommendation).

Block would be super useful, I could hide stuff I have no interest in ever seeing and avoid writing blog posts second guessing a music service I love. High-fives all around.
