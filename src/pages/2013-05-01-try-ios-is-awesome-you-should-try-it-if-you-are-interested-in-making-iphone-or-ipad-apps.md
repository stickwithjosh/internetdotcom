You know what's cool? Building iPhone and iPad apps.

You can build something not many people know how to build. Plus your friends and family can see it on their phones. It's like being an astronaut or a mad scientist, but better because you can wear flip flops to work.

You know what's lame? Learning how to build an iPhone app is lame.

You have to install Xcode (which seems like it's always being updated). Xcode is slow and annoying to use. Then you have to figure out it's interface before really learning any Objective-C. That's lame too.


My buddies at [Code School](http://codeschool.com) are wizards. They made a way so that you could type real honest-to-god code into your web browser window like it was a tweet or a Facebook comment, hit a button and run it on a Mac somewhere in a dark cave. It's amazing.

If you are one of the people who want to build iPhone apps but don't know where to get started, [try their course](http://tryios.codeschool.com). The first level is free, and it's cheap if you want to keep it rolling. You don't even have to make an account at first, just jump in and try it out.

Here's some sweet Behind The Scenes video:

**Disclaimer:** I know and love the people who make Code School and wish them success and happiness. It would have been smart for me to ask for an affiliate code or some other way to make money on this endorsement, but I am not that smart. You'll just be sending money to them, which is a good thing.
