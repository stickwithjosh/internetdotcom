Starting in January I began a project to write a new congregational worship song every week and I called that project [52Worship](http://52.joshuablount.com/). This was largely a challenge to keep me writing throughout the year, I wasn't terribly worried about writing very good songs, just making sure that I was flexing my writing muscle consistently and hoping that out of 52 I might have 5-10 songs that we're decent at the end of the year.

I stayed reasonably consistent up until around Easter. Easter is a huge deal in the modern american church (Jesus coming back from the dead is a huge deal to us) so most worship leaders are pretty busy that time of the year. 

Adding to the confusion and lack of time Melissa and I decided to [step down from leadership at our home church](joshuablount.com/posts/2012/leaving-leadership-whistling-pines/) and to move our family across the country the following week.

I had the idea that I might have more time for songwriting since I wasn't leading the worship department at Whistling Pines, but I've been spending so much time working with other local churches and still participating at Whistling Pines occasionally I've actually had less time to write.

####Gone, not forgotten

Now, I haven't written a new worship song for about 3 months ([and I wrote that one](http://soundcloud.com/stickwithjosh/dont-hide-your-face-from-me) pretty suddenly on our back porch while sitting with friends, so I'm not even sure that one counts) but this project is still close to my heart.

I can't quite finish it under the current set of rules (I made a rule about "catching up" or writing songs after the week has ended) but I think I'm going to make a concerted effort to try and close the year with 52 songs. As it stands now, there are about 10 weeks left in the year, and I've written 13 songs, so I've got 39 songs left to write over the next 2.5 months with an average of 4 songs each week.

####From there to here

I think the only way to accomplish this goal is to slow down my work with other churches and pair down my music projects to leading and playing at Whistling Pines a few times a month and songwriting. I'm also considering gathering a few friends one Saturday to do a bit of a writing day at my house to try to knock out a chunk of songs.

I'm not sure how far I'll get, but I'm willing to try and I realize that I'll have to shift some things around to meet my ridiculous goal.
