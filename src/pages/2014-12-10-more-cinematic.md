title: "More Cinematic"

<p>Most of the time when I’m walking around the city I am listening to podcasts.</p><p>Last month I was noticing how many other people have headphones in while walking around, assumming they aren’t all listening to podcasts I wondered aloud <a href="https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/534394441855819776">if all these other people were listening to music</a>.</p><p>This morning after dropping my kid off at his school I walked the eleven blocks to my office while listening to <a href="http://rd.io/x/QFF1Pg361w/">J. Cole’s new album</a> and was surprised at how cinematic it made my walk seem. Every chunk of sidewalk, every person hurrying to their destination, even the vehicles circling around the streets seemed to &nbsp;be interacting and dancing with the beats coming out of my headphones.
</p><p>Not sure this really matters beyond reminding me how things I don’t always understand at first can be incredibly delightful. I should spend more time trying out things I don’t understand the benefit of—frequently friends and neighbors that are doing things I wouldn’t have found something magical that I’m missing.</p>
