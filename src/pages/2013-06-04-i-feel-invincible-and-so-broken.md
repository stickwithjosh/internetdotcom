title: "I feel invincible and so broken"
---
Most days I feel invincible.

Obviously I have my problems (I make the worst typos of any human being on the planet, for instance) but most of my life has been awesome and I'm grateful for it.

Some days I feel irreversibly broken.

It's not depression like I've heard about from some people, but I sleep (a lot) and can't seem to focus or work on just about anything (including minor conversations).

I have periods where the bad days seem far enough away that I wonder if I'll ever have another one. I think this is a small lie I tell myself to keep from worrying about the whole thing.
