I've spent a lot of time this past week on phone calls and having meetings about setting up new [work](http://joshuablount.com/work/). In most of these calls I have some goals:

* Give me lots of money
* Give me that money ahead of time
* Let me work when / where I want to

Usually the client has a different set of goals:

* Give me less money
* Wait to give me money until the last possible minute
* (sometimes) make me work during their office hours and sometimes from their office

As Merlin Mann says, “Everyone has their reasons”.

##It’s nobody’s fault.

The first thing I've tried to learn is that it is totally normal for my goals to not line up 100% with the clients. We are different entities and our best interests will never be perfectly aligned.

The second thing that's important to remember is that it's not wrong to try and swing the pendulum as close to your goals as you can. Usually the entity with the most power (in business power and money are frequently interchangeable) gets to exert their influence and the negotiations will align more closely with their goals than with the other party.

##Have power, or pretend to have power

Because so much of these initial negations are about who has power you either need to have power or pretend to have it.

For the enterprising contract web worker this means frequently appearing like you have too much work when you don't. It could also mean lining up twice as much work as you can handle so that you can make sure money is available if one of the projects falls though.

The only thing I know ensures I feel powerful in these negotiations is a couple months expenses in the bank and at least one significant chunk of work on the horizon. Otherwise I jump at every new piece of work that is even remotely close to my hourly rate.

Sometimes I end up either over extending myself (doing work I'm not yet competent in) or over committing myself (taking on more work than I have time for).

##Negotiations are negotiations

Future self: my only real recommendation is to remember that negotiations are negotiations. Remember that both parties have something they want to give and something they want to get. Try your best to shift things toward your goals without taking undue advantage of any power you might have, because power, like so many things, is temporary.
