<p>When senseless gun tragedies happen, I think about the guy who at one point in life I considered my best friend.</p>

<p>He suffers from various things after a stint in the army and a trip to Iraq. We were in punk rock bands together (the kind that never played a show), but now he <a href="http://jonbhorton.wordpress.com">writes a fanatical blog</a> from somewhere far away and he deactivated his Facebook maybe a year ago.

<p>After the last time we hung out a few years ago and his political differences started to become more apparent, I realized we had grown apart. After a few twitter comments I decided it was better to ignore him.</p>

<p>I worry about him, but I&#8217;m not sure if I have the capacity to help. We live far away and have such different life styles, I&#8217;m not even sure what we would talk about at this point.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is how that progression starts. Isolation isn&#8217;t good for humans. I don&#8217;t know who else he&#8217;s interacting with, or what he might some day be capable of. I don't know if I'm over-reacting or if this is a legitimate concern</p> 

<p>That's how I know that this problem is more about mental health than it is about gun control.</p>
