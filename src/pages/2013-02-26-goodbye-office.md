Today I handed over the keys to my office.

Sometime last year I started renting a small office in 'downtown' Mount Dora. I had worked from home for years but when Conor was born and both my wife and kid were within arms reach during my working day I discovered the need for a little additional work / life separation.

The office was small, just big enough for a desk and a loop to pace while on phone calls. The walls were incredibly thinâ€“I could [hear everything that was going on in the neighboring offices](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/304234763424763906). To my dismay (and the detriment of [my most recent obsession](http://www.internetpodcasts.com)) the office was also incredibly echoey and bad for phone calls or voice recordings.

Concrete things feel good, helps me feel like everything isn't made up or going to vanish without warning. I'm glad I had that office, even for a little while. It made me feel like it wasn't something that could just disappear if I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

I think I'll probably end up looking for another office after we move.
