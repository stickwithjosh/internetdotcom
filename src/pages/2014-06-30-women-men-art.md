[Shad](http://shadk.com) is one of my favorite rappers. His work projects a person who is thoughtfully engaged with the world around him, someone who’s grappling with cultural problems as complex as they come.

Those lyrics are from a song that I love called “Keep Shining”:

</div>

I’ve cried every time I’ve heard this song, including both times I've seen him perform it live as well as when I rewatched the video to embed it. It’s incredibly moving, and I’m really glad he wrote it.

###Identifying the Problem

Music is dominated by men. You can see this within the church, in indie rock, and in hip hop. I've been thinking about what this means and how I can help. Lately, I’ve turned a critical eye toward men in the industry.

The last time I saw Shad play, his band consisted of a bass player and a DJ, both men. Even while Shad was performing a song where he eloquently professes a longing for more female participation in rap, I couldn’t help but notice that his entire tour crew was male.

###A Numbers Game

Some might wonder why I’m pointing out Shad's all-male band when he’s trying to speak truth inside a genre that isn't known for its positive depictions of women. But if I can't expect him to walk the walk, then how can I expect that of other artists?

Many other bands I love have this same problem. I’ve seen [The World Is A Beautiful Place And I Am No Longer Afraid To Die](http://theworldis.bandcamp.com) play a few times, and I adore them. Only two of the seven musicians on stage were women. And those are relatively good numbers compared to most of the bands.

###Me Too

As I call these bands out, I should point out that my own creative work faces this problem, too. Only one woman participated over the [last](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/episode/superman-iii) [five](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/episode/edge-tomorrow) [episodes](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/episode/godzilla-2014) [of](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/episode/x-men-days-future-past) [Hypothetical](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/episode/frozen) (my wife, during an episode about Frozen). And of our fourteen contributors over two years, only three have been women.

I’ve made some attempts to include more women, but I need to do better. I’ve always invited women to participate but I’m going to better focus those efforts and offer women I know and follow online specific opportunities to join in by asking them to talk with us about a favorite movie of theirs. Hypothetical would be a better show if it had more female voices.

###TODO: Fix

Men—especially those who are doing creative and collaborative work—need to find ways to work with women. And men need to find ways to support  art and projects that are led by women. It’s absolutely unreasonable for men to expect women to be solely responsible for correcting the imbalance in the world.

This isn’t just about equality—it's about realizing that the world would be better if more female voices, opinions, and art played a part in what we consume and think about every day. Men, including myself, have the responsibility to work with women and find ways to step out of the spotlight so we can showcase female talent, thoughts, and ideas.
