title: "Old men make all the decisions"

A quick update on my piece about [the effects of availability on culture and taste](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/62441928117/how-netflix-spotify-and-availability-will-shape-our).

Friend and rails developer-for-hire [Josh VanCleef](http://joshvc.com/) suggested [the following](https://twitter.com/joshvc/status/383691204342599680):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh">@stickwithjosh</a> Our little ones will never know a world where their only choices in primetime are dictated by 45-60 year olds.</p>&mdash; Josh Van Cleef (@joshvc) <a href="https://twitter.com/joshvc/statuses/383691204342599680">September 27, 2013</a></blockquote>

But I think he's wrong (donâ€™t worry, [I told him as much](https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/383691651446620160)).

I also spoke to real life and [Collective Agency](http://collectiveagency.co/) coworker Stephanie who echoed my sentiment.

*First*, old men have largely been deciding what we can watch on television. A huge reason for this is **the cost of television production**. Since it costs so much it's hard to experiment on new things and the only people making television at a certain level are rich & old.

*Second*, while those rich old men aren't currently making decisions for Conor about scheduling, they are totally **the same people** in charge of deciding what shows are available for streaming. **Gatekeepers** with the task of deciding what will and won't be available for my families viewing.

*Third*, at least at this point, **this has always been the case**. Because of the incredible cost associated with creating relatively high-quality television, the people with the money make the decisions.

**Note:** I wrote this last September, but it seems still relevant.
