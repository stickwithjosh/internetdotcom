I saw an incredible demo last night at [Demolicious](http://demolicious.tv/portland/) of a new iOS / Mac (system? platform? thingie?) called [Knock](http://www.knocktounlock.com/) and it got me very excited about [Bluetooth LE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy).

Knock is an app that tries to make your existing passwords more secure. Founder [William Henderson](https://twitter.com/quicklywilliam) showed us how he unlocks his laptop - he just taps twice on his phone (which was in his pocket at the time) which is registered by the login screen of OS X by a subtle ring of color around his avatar, then logged him in. If you are the sort of person that locks their laptop every time you might be as interested as I am, but wait - there's moreâ„¢!

Knock is also in early stages of working with many sites that have [two-factor authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) (I believe William mentioned working with Twitter, Facebook, GitHub so far). In a similar way, William was at the Dropbox website that was asking for his credentials. He typed in an email address and the password and when the page refreshed to ask for his two-factor auth code he tapped his phone twice again and the form was filled out and submitted automatically.

Beyond websites and operating systems William also mentioned that they had their sites on larger things (unlocking doors, cars, etc). I'd guess they'll be launching at some point after iOS 7 is released to the public and I couldn't be more excited.
