title: "#mondaymorningmusicvideos: Further Seems Forever Edition"
---
Today is a special edition of [#mondaymorningmusicvideos](http://log.joshuablount.com/tagged/mondaymorningmusicvideos) (and not only because it's monday afternoon).

[Further Seems Forever](http://furtherseemsforever) are a band I've loved over the years, and they just [dropped a new album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVB2EWQjXE8) (with their original lineup and after a hiatus that followed quite a few lineup changes). The new album is decent and I'm more than happy to enjoy it with all the nostalgia of growing up with these guys.
