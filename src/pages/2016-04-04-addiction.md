I've chewed my fingernails since before I can remember. One day about four years ago I stopped without really noticing until my fingernails were long enough that I felt them dig into the keys when I was typing.

I've been drinking alcohol pretty frequently since I turned 21 (drugs are easier to get early than that in Florida, so... yeah.). About two years ago when I started exploring what was going on in my brain that turned into a diagnosis of Bi-Polar II I figured I should stop drinking while I tried different medications. Two or three months after my prescribing nurse said I'd be fine if I wanted to drink. I just never started again.

My brother has been calling a lot from Florida. He's the least stable of three brothers I grew up with (I have another 8 or so, a story for another time) and is in and out of rehab, jail and homelessness pretty frequently.

One of the results of my personal brain complications is that taking his calls can derail my focus for days. Even if it's just fifteen minutes and he's just asking for cash again my brain just gets locked in a spiral of concern and judgement.

So I let his calls go to voicemail. Over and over. My number is one of a handful he has committed to memory, so he calls. Again and again. And I never answer.

I don't pretend that accidentally stopping dropping fingernail biting and booze are equivalent to actual serious addictions. I sat through enough (probably hundreds) of NA meetings as a kid with my parents to know that addiction really is a disease.

I don't pretend that my mental well being is more important than his health and safety. I love him very much and long for him to find stability and community.

The only thing I can say is that I am powerless if I pick up the phone and if I'm powerless I can't take care of myself (or anyone else).

That's addiction.
