Lately I've been borderline obsessed with generosity.

More and more, as I look at Jesus' life represented in the bible, I'm taken with his generosity. From his first public miracle (free booze for a party), to including the disciples in his public ministry, all the way to eventually giving his life - Jesus spent his time giving.

Last week while introducing the offering to the church I was leading worship at, I communicated another simple truth about God's infinitely generous nature. God did not bring Jesus back from death because he missed his son, he brought Jesus back from the death to **give life to humanity**.

In the current version of the world, christianity seems to be branded by rules, archaic thinking, patriarchy and hate - but what I see over and over again in the bible is love and (as the result of that love toward others) generosity.
