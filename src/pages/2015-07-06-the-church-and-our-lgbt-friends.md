title: "The church and our lgbt friends."

Honestly, the LGBT community isn't missing out on the church, we're missing out on them. Being a part of their stories, learning from them and honoring their ability to minister to us.

They'll be fine. They've shown that in fostering their own communities because they've been shut out of &ldquo;ours&rdquo;. They've built networks of trust, safety and fellowship that are sincere examples of god's kingdom.

And Jesus? I'm guessing he is totally uninterested that you don't like two dudes kissing and I'm seriously doubting he needs anyone to believe in him for him to love and rescue them.

Don't overstate your importance in the redemption of the world.
