title: "Why I just built a tiny podcast publishing CMS"
---
<p>So, I just built a tiny <a href="https://github.com/stickwithjosh/hypodrical">Django based podcast app</a> to publish the <a href="http://internetpodcasts.com">podcasts that I&#8217;m working on with my friends</a>.</p>

<h2>URLS</h2>

<p>Dude, URLs are important. I know most people don&#8217;t care about them, but it seemed ridiculous to have sometimes 3 or 4 of my friends take their time to talk with me about movies and have a url like <a href="http://hypotheticalpodcast.com/post/36604193208/looper-im-accustomed-to-overlooking-bad-science-in">hypotheticalpodcast.com/post/36604193208/looper-im-accustomed-to-overlooking-bad-science-in</a>.</p>

<p>There is some irony in the fact that my personal blog is also a Tumblr thing, but my personal blog is of very little consequence to me while these podcasts have become one of my favorite creative projects.</p>

<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>Put simply, Tumblr rolled out a new version and markdown support is sketchy. This meant it took multiple attempts to make sure that the bits I needed to make the podcast feed work happened and it was really annoying. Markdown preview is also halfway broken, which is a bummer but will probably be fixed soon.</p>

<h2>You get what you pay for?</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t actually believe that. Tumblr is great and I point anyone asking me about writing online to Tumblr because of the quick setup and easy baked community from tag searches. I&#8217;m also fond of the fact that they let you embed your own javascript into their themes (which is how I made sure that all the old Tumblr short urls are pointing at the new site now).</p>

<p>I think a better axiom is &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to be particular, better to do it yourself&#8221;. Hypothetical went from an idea, to a test and now a pet project and it&#8217;s unfair of me to expect my taped together solution to work in very specific ways.</p>

<p>Onward and upward. If you&#8217;ve got the chops <a href="https://github.com/stickwithjosh/hypodrical">I could use some help on the code which is hosted on GitHub</a>.</p>
