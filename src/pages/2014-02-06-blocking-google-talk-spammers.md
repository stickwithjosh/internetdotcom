title: "Blocking Google Talk Spammers"
---
I pretty frequently get requests from spam accounts to be added on Google Talk. A few days ago I accidentally approved one and was getting approximately 2-3 random greetings a day.

Looking through Messages in OS X I realized that there was a "block" item in some of the menus, that option was greyed out when using Google Talk (the block option was available via my AIM account).

Thankfully, there's another way to block people (or robots) after the fact via Google's social network dingus. Simply head over to [Google Plus](http://plus.google.com). You'll see recent chats over on the right side, opening up the related chat will show you an option to block the account so that you don't receive any more unwanted messages.
