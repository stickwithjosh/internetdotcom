title: "Getting your UDID for your iOS device when in “Activation Error”"
---
I just made the mistake of attempting to install the latest iOS 7 beta on my iPad mini, without having added the device to my Apple Developer account. Super annoying because you get stopped at an "Activation Error" screen, which keeps you from getting the UDID in the normal ways via iTunes or in the Settings app on your device.

Luckily, if your iPad is plugged into your Mac you can get your UDID by opening System Information > USB > (name of device). It's labeled Serial Number, but I just added mine to my Apple Developer account and it worked perfectly.
