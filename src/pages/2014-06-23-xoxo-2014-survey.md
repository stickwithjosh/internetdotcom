title: "XOXO 2014 Survey"

Tomorrow, [the XOXO festival will open up it's survey](http://blog.xoxofest.com/post/89372829600/2014-registration).

I went to the festival [the last](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/31861329659/love-for-xoxo-2012) [two years](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/62069832142/xoxo-just-ended), and had talked myself out of trying to go this year all the way until they announced the survey [last week](https://twitter.com/xoxo/status/480035667062571008).

My experience the previous two years was remarkable. I don't like conferences very much, and am incredibly awkward in most social settings, but XO has the magical ability to make all that OK.

One nice thing last year was that for some of the festival events I got to bring Melissa along. Not only is she fun to hang around, I also get to pretend I'm being social when hanging out with her.

Anyway, I'll be filling out their survey tomorrow, so I thought I'd post the answers here. Nothing that interesting, although it does prove that I'm not super interested in "leveraging" the "audience" for my "brand" or whatever.

###What do you do?

I make the internet. Usually for clients in exchange for money. In some special instances for myself in exchange for fun.

###What are you working on right now?

I'm building a application for a small startup that does subscription based tutoring for college students with video chat, collaborative editing and other fancy things.

###What’s something you’ve made that you’re proud of?

I'm very proud of my son, whom I had a small part in making and [Hypothetical](http://hypotheticalpodcast.com) - a podcast I do talking about movies with friends that is somehow still irregularly recording almost two years later.
