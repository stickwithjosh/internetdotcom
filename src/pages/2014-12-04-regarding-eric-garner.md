I'm more of a bad poet than a good lawyer - but I believe that Eric Garner was murdered. I use this word because I firmly believe it and also to communicate my own guilt and longing for change, not to shame people that disagree with me.

There are a lot of things that go into my opinion about Mr. Garner, but primarily in the footage I see a man begging for his life and another man killing him. In reading about the various degrees of murder it seems to me that this was somewhere between second-degree and voluntary manslaughter, but sadly I don't think I'll find out what a jury would say on the matter.

Secondarily I believe that there is a system of racism, sexism and oppression baked into American culture, politic and law. This system makes it easy for police officers to bring down the kind of violence I'm uncomfortable with on marginalized people in our country with particularly bad consequences for black men.

Acknowledging racism, privilege and complicit guilt are methods for change. We can't affect change until we acknowledge the problem. If you're not there yet, I totally understand that, but I think you're wrong.
