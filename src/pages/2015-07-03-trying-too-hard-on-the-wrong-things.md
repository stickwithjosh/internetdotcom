title: "Trying too hard on the wrong things."

<p>People have been telling me I&rsquo;m smart and good at various things for much of my life. As far as I can tell this has given me a fear of revealing that I&rsquo;m dumb and not good at various things. The result of this is that I&rsquo;ve spent a long time not trying very hard.</p>

<p>Trying hard feels like it would expose me. If I try hard and fail then it reveals an internal lack. If I don&rsquo;t try and fail it only reveals a lack of interest.</p>

<p>This attitude has served me well enough. I have a moderate amount of success, my life is filled with people I love and my interests are varied and engaging.</p>

<p>But, I think I could do better. So I&rsquo;ve decided to try hard at becoming a film maker.</p>

<h2>Putting the work in</h2>

<p>I love making things, polishing and refining them until they are the best they can be. Video is probably my favorite format of all the things I have experience with, and I&rsquo;d like to make more of them - both for clients and for myself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing extensive research, trialing and testing. I&rsquo;ve purchased equipment after elaborate questions and consideration. I&rsquo;ve watched video after video from experts describing how to pull of the effects, looks, and audio I want. I&rsquo;ve read a pile of articles about working with &ldquo;talent&rdquo; and generating ideas to help you tell stories through short films and promotional videos.</p>

<h2>The gig</h2>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to work with a really cool non-profit on a Kickstarter video. I believe in the work they&rsquo;re doing and was super excited to work on the project even though they didn&rsquo;t have any budget to pull it off. Free seems like a totally reasonable price to pay someone with limited experience and a full-time job.</p>

<p>I wanted to really do this well for them. I was ready to try hard and make something great. But I put in all of my time in effort into things that <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> making the video.</p>

<p>I spent about 2 hours working on a script and shot list -  I had read these are important to have before starting to film so that you could make sure you have all your shots ahead of time.</p>

<p>I spent a ton of time communicating with the interviewees that were to be in the video. Finding ways to get myself to them with the appropriate gear was a huge hassle that I put a lot of effort into.</p>

<p>When finally on location to shoot I spent much of the time finding elaborate ways to hide microphones and setting up two cameras so I had multiple angles.</p>

<p>Here are the things I should have spent time on:</p>

<ul><li><p><strong>Talking to the client</strong> - they had a really specific vision for the video along with a script. When they described it as a &ldquo;draft&rdquo; I assumed it meant they were &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; and not the things they literally wanted people to say on camera. This totally didn&rsquo;t require an additional script and could have limited the shot list drastically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paying attention to exposure and framing</strong> - I should have been spending a lot more time thinking and working on the exposure and framing (and working with my second shooter to do the same) when I was shooting. Some of the shots I got looked amazing, but almost 20% of it was over exposed and another 10% was so badly framed I couldn&rsquo;t use it. This would have been a lot more useful than hiding lapel mic cables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Checking and double checking gear</strong> - I had a great experience with audio generally, but in one instance the talent was projecting super loud and I should have found a way to compensate but gave up after a minute or so of talking to them. The audio was blown out and super hard to understand. I also had an interview get cut down to one camera between one of my cameras overheating as well as not adjusting it when the interviewee shifted placing them out of focus.</p></li>
</ul><p>In editing I started to notice these problems and did my best to work around them and produce something good. When I passed an initial edit to the client they called me and were super disappointed suggesting they thought it was best to start over with another film maker.</p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m still pretty crushed about this. It was a huge blow hearing them tell me the various problems they had with the end product.</p>

<p>The first thing I&rsquo;ve done was to watch the video a few times and take some notes. Most of the significant problems I listed above which helped me understand where the client was coming from and direct my focus back to concrete steps to fix for next time rather than letting this defeat my interest in film.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve decided to work on a short sketch with a friend as a way to regain a bit of confidence on a less serious project. I don&rsquo;t want this to effect my path - surely there will be other set backs - I&rsquo;m hoping it will lead me to be creating better work in the future.</p>
