John Gruber’s [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) is my favorite weblog (or blog).

I have a late night in front of me (working to catch up on a deadline) and while walking back from the local corner store to purchase caffeine in Diet Dr. Pepper shaped containers I was listening to [Mr. Gruber’s Podcast](http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/) and thinking about his trajectory to being a career-writer.

####The List™

* [The very first “Fireball”](http://daringfireball.net/2002/08/baby_needs_a_new_pair_of_processors) is dated August 13<sup>th</sup>, 2002. 
* In July of 2007 Gruber wrote [Independent Days](http://daringfireball.net/2003/07/independent_days) explaining his introduction of Google AdSense (including a link to a now 404’d article on [Dan Benjamin's](http://benjamin.org/dan/) [Hivelogic](http://hivelogic.com/).<sup>[1](#brokenlinks)</sup>
* In June of 2004 Gruber wrote [Something Daring](http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/something_daring) launching his first membership program (for a small fee you get a member’s only RSS feed of full-length articles)
* In April of 2006 Gruber wrote [Initiative](http://daringfireball.net/2006/04/initiative) declaring his taking Daring Fireball full-time after quitting his full-time gig with Joyent.

####Other interesting points

* As far as I can recall, I began reading Daring Fireball sometime in early 2004 (a year before I married my wife!). Looking over the articles the only one I remember vividly is [this one about the Linked List](http://daringfireball.net/2004/11/linked_list_placement) posted in November of that year.
* Less than a year after Gruber took Daring Fireball full-time, the iPhone is announced and subsequently released.
* I think it would be a little crass to publish [Daring Fireball’s current feed sponsorship rates](http://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/) here, but the number feels high to me. Somehow, as a part of his audience for nearly ten years I feel a strange sense of pride that Gruber can command such terrific rates.
* [Shawn Blanc's interview with Gruber](http://shawnblanc.net/2008/02/interview-john-gruber/) from 2008 is also interesting reading, if you'd like more of these sort of data points and behind-the-scenes anecdotes.
