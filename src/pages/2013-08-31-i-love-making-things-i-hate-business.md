title: "I love making things, I hate business"

I love making things, but I hate business.

Making things means [writing code](http://github.com/stickwithjosh). Making things means figuring out how to get a functional project done on an incredible time frame. Making things means figuring out how to [serve 100k concurrent users](http://fightforthefuture.org) with the free tier of your favorite web hosting service.

Making things is creative. Making things is exploratory. Making things is fulfilling because [something that didn't exist before now exists](http://hypotheticalpodcast.com) and helps people.

Business has always befuddled me. Business feels like an extension of becoming an adult. Business seems like something my Dad loves, not something I love.

Business means figuring out tax stuff. Business means paying stupid amounts of money on insurance even when you aren't sure where next months paycheck is coming from. Business means booking work and sales calls and harassing your Twitter friends for leads and ideas for new work.

I think what I'm realizing is that in order to be successful I need to treat my business as one of the things that I'm making and not just the fluctuating details of how I'm paying rent at any given moment.
