title: "Bluetooth flaky on initial beta of OS X Yosemite"
---
If you are like me, maybe you installed OS X Yosemite on your work laptop as soon as it was released.

Maybe you found that it was acceptable in most cases except for bluetooth suddenly failing every hour or so.

Maybe you also run [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) and a quick way to turn bluetooth on and off (from your laptop when your external keyboard fails) would be helpful.

[Here is the workflow to use](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/4162-bluetooth-power-toggle-workflow/), totally functional on Yosemite, no external dependencies.
