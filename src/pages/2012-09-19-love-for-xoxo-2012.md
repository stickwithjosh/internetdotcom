This weekend, I was in Portland for [XOXO](http://xoxofest.com).

XOXO is "XOXO is an arts and technology festival celebrating disruptive creativity". [Mr Andy Baio](http://waxy.org) ([@waxpancake](http://twitter.com/waxpancake)) & [Mr Andy McMillan](http://goodonpaper.com) ([@goodonpaper](http://twitter.com/goodonpaper)) collobarated as the organizers - it was Baio's first time, but McMillan's yearly [Build Conf](buildconf.com) is held in very high esteem. If you ask [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com):

####My experience

Leading up to the event I was excited to be in Portland (we're moving there in March), I was excited about  meeting some of my friends and heroes for the first time, and I was excited about hanging out with my cohort [Mr Tyler Hunt](http://tylerhunt.com) for the weekend.

What I didn't expect was for the event to be better than I could have imagined. From the talks, to the details around the event space and even the bathroom we all felt well cared for during our stay.

One of the defining characteristics for me was the hopefulness. In the talks, in the attendees, in the things for sale - there was a youthful hope permeating the entire event. Everyone there seemed experienced enough to avoid blind enthusiasm, but **hope was a thread deeply rooted in the entire weekend**.

Something I've heard a [few](http://kottke.org/12/09/some-thoughts-about-xoxo) [people](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2012/09/xoxo.html) mention is the lack of phone and computing device use at XOXO, and it was obvious when looking around that everyone was **interested**. One of my favorite things about the community of artists, nerds and creative people that I sometimes get to call myself a member of is that everyone is so interested in everything, and I think when you gather so many interested and interesting people in the same space it doesn't leave tons of room for other endeavors.

I should also mention that I went out of my way to speak with loads of people I've followed online for years and without exception they were all charming, thoughtful and friendly. Now that I've had a few days to let my naturally introverted self recover I'm grateful for the chance to talk to so many thoughtful people.

####At a distance

If you want to get a better handle on the weekend [Anil Dash](http://dashes.com) [kept terrific notes](http://dashes.com/anil/2012/09/xoxo-jomo-live-blogging-the-conference.html), live blogging in the old school sense as the talks were going on. [Tantek Ã‡elik](http://tantek.com) and [Scott Thomas](http://simplescott.com) put together [a handy directory](http://tantek.com/xoxo-2012-directory) or you could take a look at the [twitter list](http://twitter.com/bump/xoxo) that [@bump](http://twitter.com/bump) put together if you'd like to get a handle on the kind of things XOXO attendees and speakers are doing. Thanks to all of the folks I got to say hello to, for everyone that thanked me and the team [@fightfortheftr](http://twitter.com/fightfortheftr) for our work, and especially to all the new friends and Portland locals that I connected with..

I titled this post "Love for XOXO 2012" in the hopes that next year I can write a similar post, "Love for XOXO 2012". Here's to hugs and kisses (& hope) in the future.
