2012 was a ***complicated*** year.

In what amounts to one fell swoop Melissa and I have decided to uproot our family, go public on our non-fundamentalist view of life the universe and everything and to otherwise piss just about everyone we know off at least a little bit.

2012 was my most ***punk rock*** year.

I long to be more self-aware, and looking back I see a rational maturation. I’ve long been dissatisfied with the church I was working at, so I left. We’ve dreamed for 7 years about moving to Portland, OR - so we set a date and bought some plane tickets. 

2012 is the year I started saying ***FUCK YOU*** to The Fear™.

I was (and still am) afraid to leave our church. I’m afraid of how our move will succeed or fail. I’m afraid that all of the choices I make now are the wrong ones. I’m afraid that [I’ll be found out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).

But over, and over, and over again I’ve been reminding myself that the choice I make today can so easily become the choice I un-make tomorrow. So why wouldn’t I try to live the life I fantasize about? Why wouldn’t I work toward happiness, fullfillment, grace and peace for my family and those around us? Why wouldn’t I draw a line in the sand and say, “Let’s do this.”

2012 was the best year of my life. I suspsect 2013 will supplant it.
