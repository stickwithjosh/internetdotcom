Last week, [Hunter Walk said this](http://hunterwalk.com/2013/08/03/reinvent-the-movie-theater-wifi-outlets-low-lights-second-screen-experience/), “I’d love to watch Pacific Rim in a theater with a bit more light, wifi, electricity outlets and a second screen experience. Don’t tell me I’d miss major plot points while scrolling on my ipad – it’s a movie about robots vs monsters. I can follow along just fine.”

In response to the response around Hunter's post, [Anil Dash wrote this](http://dashes.com/anil/2013/08/shushers-wrong-about-movies-wrong-about-the-world.html), “But those of us who are okay with movie theaters sometimes having distractions are here. We’re the majority. We’re normal. Your bullying hasn’t worked. The only logical next step is to find a way to accommodate us. Or you could do that thing where you turn around and glare really fiercely—it seems to be working great!”

I talked briefly to friend and [Hypothetical](http://hypotheticalpodcast.com) contributor [Carlo Simone](http://cgsimone.tumblr.com) on an upcoming episode of our movie review podcast wherein I felt as though I didn't really know what side of this discussion I felt more inclined toward.

* I respect the desire of people who want to experience movies in a way that resembles the traditional, mostly silent and dark cinema.
* I really, really like watching movies and can't spend more than 10 or so hours per week in the theater (which is already kind of an insane amount). Watching things on my laptop, TV, iPhone and iPad are all substations for this (what I would call) most ideal experience.
* Also, when I am in the theater, I would occasionally enjoy checking in on my phone without bugging everyone around me.

Last night, my family went to see [The Princess Bride at Pioneer's Square](http://storify.com/stickwithjosh/the-princess-bride-pioneer-square). Pioneer's Square is a big, open area frequently used for events like this and referred to (mostly by itself) as “the living room of Portland”.

The crowd was large, maybe a couple thousand by the time the movie started, but I never noticed. Everyone cheered at the right moments, laughed at the right moments, and the experience of seeing this movie in this space was terrific. I'd even venture to say ideal.

While watching the film I:

* Talked my son through the more frightening moments
* Posted to Instagram, Twitter and commented on Facebook to friends about the movie and our experience
* Swapped seats with a friend who was watching with us

In a theater I wouldn't have been likely to do any of this, but because of the environment I felt comfortable and relaxed and really had a great time. The sound was loud enough that a bit of talking didn't bother anyone. The screen was bright (and large) enough that anyone could see that wanted to.

I'm not sure what this means about my opinions around theater experience, other than that I was surprised at how how pleasant my experience was with my friends and neighbors in Pioneer Square.
