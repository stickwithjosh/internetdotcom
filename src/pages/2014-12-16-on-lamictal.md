title: "On Lamictal"
---
I’ve been taking a prescription mood stabilizer named [Lamictal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamotrigine) for a few months as a result of a recent diagnosis of [Bipolar II disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder).

One thing the nurse practitioner that is working with me on medications clarified ahead of time was that while Lamictal can be used in the treatment of epilepsy and seizures, it also has been used to provide maintenance assistance for people with mood disorders like Bipolar and Bipolar II.

My experience with mood problems was typically limited to random and rare periods of depression followed by briefer periods of mania or “up”.

Here are a few details about my experience with these symptoms, primarily it took me quite a while to realize that what I was dealing with was depression (coupled with lighter mania) because I was expecting that would feel sad or bad. For me, it was mostly being tired and uninterested.

### Depression

* Measured in weeks, not months or days
* Lots of sleep, sometimes as much as 15-20 hours
* Total inability to work, have phone calls about work and write emails about work. Combination of anxiety and lowered cognitive capacity.
* Very little interest in typically interesting activities (work, socializing on the internet, music, etc)
* Paralyzing anxiety in conversation, quietness
* Confusion about timeline of events, even very recent activities (did we go to the store today, or was that yesterday?)
* Subtle lack of hope
* A period of low “mania” afterward

### Mania

* Measured in days, not hours or weeks
* Extreme chattiness, all the time
* Mind racing, coming up with creative projects, business ideas, and solutions nobody needs
* Severe lack of sleep, 0-4 hours

## Getting Help

I had tried a few times before to seek psychiatric help with limited success. It takes such a long time to find someone you are comfortable with, sort out the money and insurance side of things, and then finally to start sorting out the situation that I gave up multiple times.

It’s also a little scary opening yourself up in this way, revealing vulnerabilities to someone you don’t know. This isn’t usually a problem for me, but sometimes I hard a hard time not making every response to probing questions a joke; I was trying to diffuse my sensitivity by appearing to take things lightly.

Being aware of my problem for such a long time, I was already pretty convinced I had some sort of chemical problem rather than a purely emotional situation. As a result, I knew that I need to talk to someone that could prescribe medication, but also wanted to talk with someone through some of this stuff as well as other things.

It took about three years for me to discover in most cases this would mean having a relationship with two separate people that could help me with each thing. Not something they tell you when you try googling, “Dr who can prescribe meds and talk to me”.

## After

Although I’ve been on the medication for a while I’ve had a hard time **really** getting a handle on the results — so much of my experience can be attributed to the [placebo effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo) of taking any sort of drug and with the problematic thing being my mood and brain, it’s very difficult to separate an emotional response to the sense of being treated from the actual physiological effects of the pharmaceuticals.

Generally, I feel pretty even most of the time with some slight ups that seem related to when I take the meds. Not exactly a high, but definitely more chatty and overly engaged.

My nurse had me on a course that ramped up until my current dosage of 150 MG every 12 hours because of some gnarly potential side effects ([death rash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%E2%80%93Johnson_syndrome) - don’t click that if you are squeamish) so now I’m at what she described as a low to average dosage.

I haven’t experienced any of my “down” periods, which is great but in the last few years there have been as much as six month periods without one of those, so I’m hesitant to say the medication has resolved them.

I was also prescribed Seroquel as a way to manage any active mood or sleep problems. I took it the other day in the prescribed dosage (150 MG) on a night where I was working late and had a hard time going to sleep. It was actually 3AM when I took it, and I had an early appointment with my therapist the next morning. When I woke up I had what amounted to the worst hangover of my life. I’m probably going to avoid taking it again unless I’m in a really serious situation.

## No Conclusions

I don’t think I’m in a place to make any conclusions yet. The reality is that I could be taking medication to help manage my mood for the rest of my life, so I have plenty of time to tweak and work with my health care provider on this.

I’m grateful for health insurance, a patient partner and a community of people around me that don’t mind me talking about my brain problems at length. Thank you.
