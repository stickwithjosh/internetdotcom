## The Setup

“…arts patronage refers to the support that kings or popes have provided to musicians, painters, and sculptors”

From the [Wikipedia article on patronage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage).

I'm not sure that all artists should be able to make a full-time living from their art, but I also don't want my favorite artists to need to invest significant portions of their free time and energies into figuring out the business side of (music, movies, etc) if they don't want to.

One of my favorite songwriters is [David Bazan](http://www.davidbazan.com). If there was some way to support his work in an ongoing fashion it would be a very easy decision for me (and I'm sure for many of his fans). This would mean that David could spend less of his time thinking about business and more doing his 'real work'.

I also sort of hate that he has taken the stance to keep his music off streaming services like [Rdio](http://rdio.com) and [Spotify](http://spotify). I get that it's a business decision for him, and a decision about the value of music (the return artists get from these services is [laughable for the broad majority of musicians](http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/09/03/less-than-a-stinkin-cent/)) but I love Rdio and use it every day—primarily because keeping a huge collection of music on the on my MacBook Air isn't really an option.

## The Idea

What if you could 'subscribe' to an artist, pay some monthly amount that they determine, in order to support their work?

There could be various incentives, and maybe even variable pricing for different levels, but I'm mostly thinking about something simple. Say $10 a month and you get access to a short video call once a month about what the artist has been up to.

Of course, you wouldn't be paying for the call, but supporting someone who's work you enjoy and getting to further participate by having inside knowledge of their work.

At $10 / person / month, you'd need maybe 800-820 people to make a $100k income. It seems like patronage like this could subsidize existing revenue streams (merch, shows, licensing?). Maybe for some artists it would be able to provide the entirety of their income and for others it would just be a small chunk, but in most cases it seems like it would provide them more opportunity to focus on the work people enjoy rather than figuring out how to turn their art into dollars and cents.

## The Rub

This sounds nice to me, although I'm just a patron, not the artist in question.

It's important to note that some of the beauty in art is struggle. For Bazan in particular some of my favorite songs relate to his work making money from his art (and I'm sure this friction is inspiration for many other artists).

I also realize that some artists might feel uncomfortable being paid for nothing, which is totally legitamate. I also know that not everyone has a large enough fan base for this sort of patronage to provide any significant income.

## How to make it work?

Right, so someone could build something to make this easy. If you kept 1% of the transactions you could make enough money to make it a full-time gig, on to a company or whatever you wanted to do with it.

The primary responsibilities would be tax and accounting related, the actual transactional nature of the application would be relatively easy using something like [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

You could also build in communication tools to make it easy for the artists to include their patrons in their work. There are lot's of fun and interesting problems to solve there.

Seems like you'd need to get a couple established artists to kick things off, maybe sign the first 5 artists up without the 1% 'fees' or whatever. It's likely you'd also have to talk them into it, then when you have some bands signed up for a while it would prove itself.

## Why not just donate $20 to Bazan every month?

This is a legitimate question. I think part of why I don't do this is because then it just feels like I'm tipping him, it doesn't feel like I'm participating in his work. I'd much rather be involved as a sort of silent partner than just throw cash his way.

Building something like this might also make it easier for artists to separate the need for money to fund their work from the actual work they produce. That album you've listened to thousands of times over the years is worth so much more than the $20 you paid on iTunes.
