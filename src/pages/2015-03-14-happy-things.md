A few things that have made me happy lately. I'd love to hear your list.

* [High school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWSgl-KjhhA) talent show [covers on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfOYGj2nxhg) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rabKhPE9rHI).
* Quiet walks with [loud music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD-rffbriWI).
* Lonely offices.
* Dancing until you hurt your knee at a hip hop show you are not sure you are cool enough for (thanks [Doomtree](http://doomtree.net)!)
