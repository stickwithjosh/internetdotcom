I suffer from self-diagnosed [depersonalization disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization). I talked a bit about [my experiences with DPD before](http://stickwithjosh.github.com/posts/2010/ways-tell-im-not-feeling-well-mental-illness/), and I'm very aware that self-diagnosis is <s>lame</s> foolish and I need to see a therapist.

Today, I'm having a really hard time focusing (a short edit to the podcast I host took about 1.5 hours instead of 3 minutes), I'm feeling a touch disoriented and having a hard time understanding people that talk to me.

Generally, I'm hopefully that this isn't going to be an extended period. I'm going to leave the caf√© where I just ate breakfast, walk upstairs and watch a movie to calm my brain down a bit and try to look at some work for my day job in a couple hours.

I think the worst part is the dread, so I'm embracing it. I might go crazy for a bit, but everything will be OK.

####Update

As far as I can tell, this was a bit of a false alarm. I felt better by close of business that day and was able to get 4-5 hours of work done even while feeling quite a bit of mental dissonance. Hooray for that.

####Update (March 2015)

At this point I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Another indicationt hat self-diagnosis is not super helpful. Just wanted to note it here for anyone arriving at this post looking for help.
