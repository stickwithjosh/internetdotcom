title: "Product Focused Developer"
---
On good days, I consider myself a product focused developer.

I'll almost never be the best programmer in the room. Likewise I feel comfortable doing design work but if you're hiring a designer I'm not going to be a great fit.

Many of my friends are wonderful engineers and programmers, but their gift is in the craft of development. Similarly I have friends who are incredible designers, but they are frequently so focused on design related matters that they forget to balance beauty and ease of use with the realities of software projects.

Somewhere in the middle of all of this is me. While readily acknowledging my own limitations as both a developer and designer, I'm typically more focused on the "why" rather than the "how".
