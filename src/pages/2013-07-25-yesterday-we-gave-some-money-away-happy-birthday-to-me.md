title: "Yesterday, we gave some money away. Happy birthday to me."

Yesterday was my birthday!

Maybe connected to a deeper fear of death or my growing lack of understanding of youth culture, I'm actually pretty bad at birthdays. I'm not great at taking compliments in general, even while being pretty self-absorbed, so tons of people being nice for no reason beyond staying alive for an additional twelve months is so weird!

A few years ago I started helping myself through birthdays by raising money for non-profits. In 2012, and this year the charity was [Charity: Water](http://www.charitywater.org) - [check out the campaign page](http://my.charitywater.org/mo-wata-mo-betta).

I might talk about what I learned or how to pull this off for people that have never tried it before, but today I just wanted to comment on my reasons. Everyone has their reasons.

Melissa and I have some money, but we are not floating in it. In fact, having recently gotten back into contracting full-time, money has been pretty scarce for us over the past few months.

“So Joshua”, you may be thinking to yourself, ”Why did you promise to match all the donations your friends made to a charity if you aren't flush with greenbacks“

Good question potential reader!

I “give away” my birthday this way because it helps me remember that I'm not the central character in every story. So much of my life is about making me happy, what I want, solving my problems. By bugging my friends to donate to a charity I get to make the story about the needs of others.

It's also a way to remind myself that money, while important, shouldn't control me in the way I frequently let it. So much of my time is occupied with the various aspects of business, especially earning money. I want my life to be about making things, sharing and generosity.

If you have a birthday, I would heartily recommend giving it to someone or something else. Not only do you get to avoid your own internal neurosis around “self” you'll also get to redirect your focus to more helpful things.
