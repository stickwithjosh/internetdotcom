I'm going through one of my [spells](http://shirt.joshuablount.com/posts/2010/ways-tell-im-not-feeling-well-mental-illness/). This one feels pretty tame I think, I've even been able to get some work done.

Something I'm noticing this time around is that while I don't really have capacity to pay attention to reading my Twitter, and I don't feel comfortable going on and on about where my head is at on Twitter, I miss my Twitter like you would miss a friend you can talk to.

When I'm doing Twitter, the things I'm considering get published and people respond.

When I'm doing Twitter, the jokes I make are sometimes faved and enjoyed by my friends.

When I'm doing Twitter, I feel more connected to the other people in my life.

So, not having the capacity to "do twitter" means losing connection to a reasonably large group of my friends. As dumb as it is, that obvious vacancy is something I feel with a sort of sharp reality. Not that it hurts, but that it is very present for me.

PS: For those overly concerned, don't be. I just need rest and space and I have an appointment with a new therapist on Saturday.
