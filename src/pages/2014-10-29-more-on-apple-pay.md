Still thinking a lot about Apple Pay. Here are a few links:

[Retailers Are Disabling NFC to Block Apple Pay](http://daringfireball.net/2014/10/nfc_apple_pay)

Gruber took the thoughts straight out of my brain, from his pen to your eyes:

> And the reason they don’t want to allow Apple Pay is because Apple Pay doesn’t give them any personal information about the customer. It’s not about security — Apple Pay is far more secure than any credit/debit card system in the U.S. It’s not about money — Apple’s tiny slice of the transaction comes from the banks, not the merchants. It’s about data.

> They’re doing this so they can pursue a system that is less secure (third-party apps don’t have access to the secure element where Apple Pay stores your credit card data, for one thing), less convenient (QR codes?), and not private.

He also pointed out [this incredible break down of what we know about Apple Pay (so far)](http://www.kirklennon.com/a/applepay.html).

Another informative piece is [Nick Arnott's detailed post on CurrentC](http://www.imore.com/depth-look-currentc-and-personal-data-they-want-collect) (the proposed answer / alternative / enemy to Apple Pay from the retailers in [Merchant Customer Exchange](http://www.mcx.com/)).

My pal Colin [predicted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/colincornaby/status/526927290572505089) that we'd see a payments alliance putting Apple & Google against the folks supporting CurrentC. From what I can tell there are a group of retailers that would likely align themselves more closely with Apple as well as the VISA / MasterCard / AmEx and the issuing banks.

I've used Apple Pay a few more times, it really is quick, intuitive and fun. It'd be great if I could use it in more places, but we'll see how it progresses.
