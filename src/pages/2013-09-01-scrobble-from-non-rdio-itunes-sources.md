I use [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/stickwithjosh) to track my music listening. I've been using it pretty steadily since April 2004 and love being able to look back on what I've been listening to over the years.

Years ago, the only thing that was recorded in Last.fm were my plays either from iTunes or my iPod. That meant that when I was listening to the various burned CDs in my car driving around small town Florida, much of my listening wasn't recorded.

More recently I've been using Rdio for the vast majority of my music listening. Rdio handles the Last.fm integration for me, I just signed into Last.fm from my Rdio account and everything I listen to via Rdio shows up at Last.fm. Easy, wonderful, etc.

But what about all the music I listen to that's not in Rdio? Frequently I listen to music on Soundcloud ([like this XX / Biggie mashup](https://soundcloud.com/wait-what/sets/the-notorious-xx)) and YouTube ([Sombear's video for Love You In The Dark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SJtSsC2kUI) is pretty great).

Because of this extra-Rdio listening, all of my stats are fouled up. 

##Solved

I think what I need is something that can log into various APIs to grab my listening history and scribble it for me. Soundcloud and YouTube are obvious examples (although as far as I can tell Soundcloud doesn't yet provide an API for this) but other things could also be added in order to get the fullest coverage of each persons music listening.
