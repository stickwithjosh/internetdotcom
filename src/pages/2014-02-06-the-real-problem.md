title: "The Real Problem"
---
Yesterday, with real panache, I [told myself to stop manipulating things](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/75712383850/stop-trying-to-manipulate-things).

Of course, The Real Problemâ„¢ is that I'm not certain I know how to stop manipulating things. Every interaction I have with another human has the lingering stench of control. Even that post was me publicly trying to convince people I'm trying to manipulate them less (itself an act of manipulation).

Is the only way to stop trying to manipulate people to stop talking? Lack of expression itself seems like another manipulation.
