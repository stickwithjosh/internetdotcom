This week I helped start a talk show about movies. We're calling it [Hypothetical Podcast](http://hypotheticalpodcast.com). I'm really proud of our first three episodes considering none of us has done anything like this before.

####Some Background

I watch **a lot** of movies. I watched 3 yesterday and one of them twice (once with the director's commentary turned on). I love movies, and I love talking about them - but I don't always get the chance to. My wife likes movies although she frequently favors sleep over them, so she doesn't watch all of them with me. Some of my friends like movies, but I don't ever feel like I have a good opportunity to talk to them.

####Enter Eric

[Eric Allam](http://twittter.com/eallam) is a friend whom I've mostly known through mutual friends. We've followed each other on TwitFacetaGram for years and even once traded laptops (I think a 13" MBP for a 15" MBP) but we've never spent much time together in real life. I've always thought he seemed like a fun and interesting guy, but striking up friendships without a common project is... complicated.

Then last week he said this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I now know what I want I my tombstone:Closed the loop</p>&mdash; Eric Allam (@eallam) <a href="https://twitter.com/eallam/status/262651163604824065" data-datetime="2012-10-28T20:24:51+00:00">October 28, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Our family has a long standing tradition of reading each other funny or interesting status updates. I of course read the above to my wife who knows me well enough to suggest Eric and I start a movie podcast. So I replied:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-in-reply-to="262651163604824065"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/eallam">eallam</a> we should be talking movies on a podcast—my wife and I concluded this last night.</p>&mdash; Joshua Blount (@stickwithjosh) <a href="https://twitter.com/stickwithjosh/status/262651423773302784" data-datetime="2012-10-28T20:25:53+00:00">October 28, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, now I've got a partner and a goal.

####We’re Just Trying This Out

I've got a schedule and about a dozen friends who might like to talk about movies, but honestly we’re just trying this out. No plans for world domination. But I'm proud of our first three episodes and I'd love for you to listen.
